The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting \u00a31.3m in.\n\"So it's a total pot of just over \u00a33m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we'd probably get five or six players.\n\"And I've always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I'd rather spend that money...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms: ", "completion": " New Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies believes a joint \u00a33.3m WRU-regions fund should be used to retain home-based talent such as Liam Williams, not bring back exiled stars."}, {"prompt": "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nArmy explosives experts were called out to deal with a suspect package at the offices on the Newtownards Road on Friday night.\nRoads were sealed off and traffic diverted as a controlled explosion was carried out.\nThe premises, used by East Belfast MP Naomi Long, have been targeted a number of times.\nMost recently, petrol bomb attacks were carried out on the offices on consecutive nights in April and May.\nThe attacks began following a Belfast City Council vote in December 2012 restricting the flying of the union flag at the City Hall.\nCondemning the latest hoax, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: \"It is a serious incident for the local area, it causes serious disruption, it puts people's lives at risk, it can prevent emergency services reaching the area.\n\"Ultimately we need people with information to share that with the police in order for them to do their job and bring these people to justice.\"\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms: ", "completion": " A suspicious package left outside an Alliance Party office in east Belfast has been declared a hoax."}, {"prompt": "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nIt has lost its previous triple-A rating from the World Energy Council (WEC) - a global body representing the energy sector.\nThe authors of the WEC report said a vacuum in energy policy since the election was deterring investors needed to create new electricity supplies.\nBut the government said it was still a world leader in energy policy.\nIt said it was committed to securing energy supplies through nuclear and shale gas.\nThe criticism from the WEC follows a complaint from the UN's chief environment scientist that the UK was turning away from renewables, just as they were being embraced by the rest of the world in the run-up to Paris climate talks this month.\nThe WEC report ranks countries on their policies to keep the lights on, bills and carbon emissions down. It says the UK has been a leader in these policies.\nBut its says the government's drastic withdrawal of subsidies for wind and solar power has deterred investors needed for new energy supplies.\nElectricity has become comparatively more expensive, and the UK remains on a \"watch-list\" over how it will secure its future energy supply.\nThe report warned the UK faced the run-down of nuclear plants and the closure of coal-powered stations, alongside ageing infrastructure - meaning its ranking is set to fall in future assessments.\nIt urged the government to ensure consistent policy to secure and maintain investments while reforms to the energy system are being implemented.\nBritain still gets an AAB rating from the council and is still in the world's top four. But that may be a let-off, because the report was written before damaging revelations in a leaked letter that the government has misled people over its progress on EU renewable energy targets.\nThe government denies misleading Parliament to believe that it will hit its mandatory 15% renewable energy target in 2020.\nBut the letter makes clear that the shortfall of approaching 25% in renewables has been hidden from the public - and over several summer months in which subsidies were being cut, journalists...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms: ", "completion": " The UK's international reputation for a strong and well-balanced energy policy has taken another knock."}, {"prompt": "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nThe warning begins at 22:00 GMT on Saturday and ends at 10:00 on Sunday.\nThe ice could lead to difficult driving conditions on untreated roads and slippery conditions on pavements, the weather service warned.\nOnly the southernmost counties and parts of the most westerly counties are expected to escape.\nCounties expected to be affected are Carmarthenshire, Powys, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Wrexham, Conwy, Flintshire, Anglesey, Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Torfaen.\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms: ", "completion": " The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice across most of Wales."}, {"prompt": "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nTony Fisher's body was found by his son in Coningswath Road in Carlton, Nottingham, on 9 January.\nJaydon Robert Barton and Nathan Barton, both 22, were charged with murder and appeared in court on Saturday.\nMarcus Barton, 41, was charged with Mr Fisher's murder in January and remains in custody.\nVincent Hawkins, 32, of Handel Street, Nottingham, has also been charged with assisting an offender and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court alongside Jaydon and Nathan Barton.\nDetectives believe Mr Fisher, 58, was \"targeted\" because it was thought he had a \"large amount of money in the house\".\nMarcus Barton, of Raymede Drive, Bestwood, who also goes by the name Marcus Pegg, is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 13 May.\nNottinghamshire Police said officers have arrested a total of 18 people during their investigation.\nAside from the four people charged, one 42-year-old man remains on bail pending further enquiries.

Japanese people are, by nature, quite reticent, but not this morning. As Jacques Rogge read out the name of the winning city they went berserk, jumping and shouting, crying and laughing.\nA few hours later, standing in the rain in Shibuya, the city's busiest shopping district, I questioned early morning shoppers coming out of the train station. The ecstasy may have been more subdued, but the sentiment was the same.\nHard as I tried I couldn't find anyone who thought it was a bad idea. So much for my journalistic cynicism.\nEconomists say Tokyoites have good reason to be cheerful. There's a lot of building to be done, and a lot of money to be spent.\nLike any Olympics, the centrepiece will be an extravagant stadium. Tokyo's has been designed by British architect Zaha Hadid. Its futuristic curves fit nicely with Tokyo's Olympic slogan: \"Discover Tomorrow.\"\nBut it comes at a huge price: more than $1.5bn.  That is just a small part of the $8bn that will be spent on refurbishing old stadiums and building new ones. So it's all good news for Japan's construction companies, who have long been suckled on the teat of government spending.\nBut all this money going it to Tokyo may be less good news for other parts of the country, particularly the Tsunami ravaged north-east coast. In many areas re-construction has still barely begun.\nAnd then there are the people of Fukushima.
