[{"prompt": "Olivia used the rule \"Add 11\" to create the number pattern shown below. 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. Which statement about the number pattern is true?\n(A) The 10th number in the pattern will be an even number.\n(B) The number pattern will never have two even numbers next to each other.\n(C) The next two numbers in the pattern will be an even number then an odd number.\n(D) If the number pattern started with an odd number then the pattern would have only odd numbers in it.", "completion": "Let's think step by step. Choice A is incorrect because every even-numbered term in the pattern is odd, and 10 is an even number. Choice B is correct, because adding an odd number (in this case 11) to an odd number produces an even number, and adding an odd number to an even number produces an odd number. Thus the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, so there will never be two even numbers next to each other. Choice C is incorrect because the last term in the example is even (54), and we know that the terms will alternate between even and odd. Choice D is incorrect because the terms in the pattern will alternate between odd and even, regardless of the value of the first term. The answer is (B)."}, {"prompt": "The population of the city where Michelle was born is 145,826.

We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players.
