{"prompt": "Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \"No answer\".\n\nQuestion: Who do Maggie and Herbie catch up to?\nMovie plot title: Herbie: Fully Loaded\nMovie plot: The plucky little #53 VW Bug named Herbie was once one of the most popular vehicles on the racing circuit in his day. However, over time, his popularity waned, until he eventually finds himself in the hands of a junk yard owner named Crazy Dave, who is planning to eventually crush the little beetle into scrap.Meanwhile, Maggie Peyton has just graduated from college, and is planning to head to New York after the summer to work for ESPN. Though she appears happy for these plans, she secretly harbors a wish to race just like her Father, Grandfather, and Brother. However, while her Father and Grandfather had the 'ambition and drive,' her brother Rey Payton Jr just doesn't have it.After her graduation, Rey Payton Sr takes his daughter to Crazy Dave's to pick out a used car of her own. Through a mishap perpetrated by Herbie, Maggie ends up as the beetle's new owner. However, once she starts Herbie up, he takes off in a mad dash to a nearby garage, owned by a young man named Kevin, who is a friend of Maggie's.Noting Herbie's condition, Kevin decides to go with Maggie for a drive to test Herbie out. However, Herbie ends up driving the two of them to a local exotic car show, where famed NASCAR racer Trip Murphy is making a publicity appearance. After Trip makes a rude comment about Herbie's condition, the little beetle creates a major scratch along the side of Trip's personal vehicle. A race soon ensues, and Maggie (wearing a racing outfit with a darkened helmet), manages to beat Trip.Herbie's beating Trip gives Maggie a thrill from winning a street race (something she promised her Dad she wouldn't do again after a serious accident some time before), but plunges Trip into a deep grudge over being beaten by an old VW beetle. Even though his manager (and brother) tells Trip to just ignore the 'fluke win,' Trip is determined to get back at Herbie and his racer. Trip then advertises a special racing event in the desert with the promise of a $10,000 cash prize to the person who beats him.The ad catches the eye of Maggie...\n", "completion": "\n\nTrip\n"}
{"prompt": "Title: Watch for allergic reaction!\nProduct review: Like other reviewers, my son also had a terrible rash after we switched from Swaddlers to Cruisers. Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion. After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse. We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days. I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day. I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem. If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?\n", "completion": "\nunflattering "}
