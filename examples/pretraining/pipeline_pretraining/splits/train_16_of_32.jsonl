{"prompt": "", "completion": "New Nuclear Watch Europe (NNWE) invites you to attend our upcoming Parliamentary Briefing on The future of nuclear energy in Europe following Brexit, due to be held in the House of Commons, London, on the 14 March 2017 at 16.00.\nThe event will focus on the opportunities and challenges facing the nuclear energy sector across Europe following Brexit. With the UK moving forward with a pipeline of new nuclear build projects, most recently with the CGN-EDF Hualong 1 application for GDA approval, this event will bring together leading policymakers, industry, academics and commentators to discuss how Europe can continue to be a global leader in nuclear energy development.\nNNWE intends to promote discussion on the need for a Pan-European, or EU+, policy framework when discussing new nuclear build. With Brexit likely to occur in 2019, and the recent announcement that the UK will be pulling out of the Euratom Treaty, NNWE envisages the development of an Organisation for Nuclear Cooperation and Development in Europe, to continue and further enhance nuclear cooperation.\nThe latest EU PINC report highlights that 105GWe of new nuclear generation will be needed by 2050 \u2013 roughly 100 new reactors \u2013 to meet existing demand and climate change targets. However, only eighteen nuclear power plants are in development, planned, or proposed within the European Union itself. Whereas ninety-five reactors are planned throughout our EU neighbours \u2013 including Belarus, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and now the UK. NNWE believes an organisation is needed to drive the future of nuclear energy development across Europe and help us reach the ambitious 2050 target.\nNNWE was established at the end of 2014 under the chairmanship of Tim Yeo (former UK Member of Parliament and Chair of the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee) and is an interest group which aims to ensure nuclear power is recognised as an important and desirable way for European governments to meet the long-term security needs of their countries."}

Do your emotions sometimes dictate your life?\nDr. Steve Peters explains that we all have a being within our minds that can wreak havoc on every aspect of our lives\u2014be it business or personal. He calls this being \"the chimp,\" and it can work either for you or against you. The challenge comes when we try to tame the chimp, and persuade it to do our bidding.\nDr. Peters explains the struggle that takes place within your mind and then shows you how to apply this understanding. Once you're armed with this new knowledge, you will be able to utilize your chimp for good, rather than letting your chimp run rampant with its own agenda."}

Although not commonly observed in modern-day Japan, the moon viewing tradition dates back to the Heian Period (794\u2013A.D. 1185), when the evening was marked with poetry and music by court aristocrats. The celebration later spread to warriors, townspeople, and farmers, and became a harvest festival.\nBring a picnic supper, beverage, and something to sit on as no food or drink will be sold at the event or pre-order an Obento from Mr. Sushi for $18 when purchasing your celebration tickets. Alcohol is not allowed at Winfrey Point, a City of Dallas park facility. For more information, visit jasdfw.org."}
