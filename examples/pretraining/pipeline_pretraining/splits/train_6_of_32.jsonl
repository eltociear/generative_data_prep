{"prompt": "", "completion": "I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It\u2019s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the \u201ctruth\u201d into a story alongside the character\u2019s perceptions. For instance, I think it\u2019s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn\u2019t get it.\nWhen I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master\u2019s point of view. Whether or not he\u2019s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry\u2019s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It\u2019s Martin\u2019s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren\u2019t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you\u2019ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He\u2019s very well-trained.\nI think it\u2019s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry\u2019s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.\nHenry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They\u2019re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he\u2019s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn\u2019t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry\u2019s growth has a greater impact on both of them.\nIt was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn\u2019t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He\u2019s very loving, but he\u2019s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin\u2019s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.\nI anticipate going a little deeper into Martin\u2019s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I\u2019ll present from Martin\u2019s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they\u2019re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I\u2019ve already covered from Henry\u2019s perspective to some extent, and when I\u2019m writing Henry, I\u2019m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.\nOffering Martin\u2019s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin\u2019s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I\u2019ve gotten the impression (whether it\u2019s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry\u2019s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin\u2019s perspective is a valuable addition."}

In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin.
