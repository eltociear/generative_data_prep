{"prompt": "", "completion": "After last weeks episode, I was really curious what they had in store for us this week. How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named \u201cThe Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain\u201d.\nWe open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.\nA tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It\u2019s Hosu\u2019s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper. Uncertified heroes using their Quirks against their instructors orders is highly frowned upon. But Todoroki is not taking it. He tells the chief that if Iida didn\u2019t step in, then Pro Hero Native would have been killed. And the both of them would have been killed without Izuku\u2019s help. But Gran Torino tells Todoroki to hear the chief out.\nKenji tells them that the punishment would only happen if this was made public. And the people would applaud their efforts anyway. But if the police kept it quiet, no one gets punished, but the boys don\u2019t get the praise they deserve. Instead Endeavor will get the praise from the masses. It would also explain Stain\u2019s burn scars. So they choose to not be celebrated as heroes and apologize anyways. But Kenji tells them he respects what they did and he thanks them for protecting the peace.\nSo it has hit the news that Endeavor has stopped hero killer Stain and the nomus from destroying Hosu City. It\u2019s all anyone is talking about. Meanwhile, we get a look at how everyone else from Class 1-A is doing in their internship programs. First we look at Bakugo who is having a less than stellar time. The first thing he wants to do is go knock some heads around but his mentor is not allowing him and says it will be business as usual. Hopefully that could help Bakugo control his temper. Kirishima finds out the reason why Midoriya sent him his location. Apparently he also reported the incident last night. Go Kirishima! Momo debuted in a commercial with her mentor and it seems obvious modelling is not what she wants to be doing. But her mentor is letting her go on patrol like she has wanted since the start of their training together.\nAnd finally there is Uraraka who is on the phone with Midoriya. She tells him how glad she is that they are all safe. Midoriya of course apologizes for not contacting sooner but she understands. In the midst of the conversation, Uraraka\u2019s mentor Gunhead reminds her that they are going to start their basic training. She then says bye to Midoriya and Gunhead asks in a very cute way, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d. And she immediately dismisses it. When Midoriya hangs up he gets all worked up that he talked to a girl on the phone. This scene was my favorite from this episode it had me busting up!\nWe get back to the guys in the hospital and Iida comes out and tells the two that he may have long-term damage in his hand. But he reflects on his actions from that night and regrets them greatly. He shouldn\u2019t have acted so swiftly and carelessly. But Midoriya doesn\u2019t let Iida beat himself up too much. He agrees that him and Iida should get stronger together.\nWe cut to U.A. with All Might in the staff room. He gets a phone call from Gran Torino. He tells All Might that he has had his teaching licence revoked for six months because of Midoriya\u2019s actions but there was no way of avoiding that and that he has come to terms with it. But All Might is very ashamed of himself for letting down his former instructor. But this isn\u2019t the reason Gran Torino called. He really wants to talk about Stain. He says in the few minutes he was with him, it had him trembling. It was because of how intimidating and obsessed he was on what he think a hero should be and what he will do to correct our society. Because this has hit so many news stations, Stains ideology and opinions will be put on blast. People will become influenced by Stain\u2019s beliefs and become a plague. But All Might doesn\u2019t believe it will be a problem because they will probably show up sporadically and they will be taken out 1 by 1. But this is where the League of Villains comes in. If they all combine their hatred and Shigaraki gives them an outlet to express and deal with their evil intentions, it will become a serious problem. Gran Torino then reminds All Might that he must tell Midoriya properly what is concerning him and One for All. Which I have no idea what that is all about. Apparently the quirk is \u201con the move\u201d? I\u2019m interested in what that might mean.\nThis episode was mostly a lot of dialogue and context but it was needed after such a shift in the story. It was refreshing getting some insight on how everyone else is doing too. I\u2019m hoping next time they elaborate on what is concerning All Might and what is happening with his quirk? Only time will tell."}
