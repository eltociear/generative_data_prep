Scotland Yard detectives have released new CCTV images showing when the pair rode past father Danny Pearce, 31, in Greenwich, South East London. The bike pair stabbed Mr Pearce, who had a daughter aged five, as he walked down the street with his girlfriend and two friends just after midnight on July 15. The father refused to hand over his watch, but was repeatedly stabbed and shot at by the robbers, before they fled - leaving him to die on the street. The new CCTV images show the moped as it drove slowly past the group, around two minutes before the attack started. As they passed the group, the pillion passenger raised his arm to point back at Mr Pearce, alerting his accomplice they have found a victim to prey upon. CCTV videos showing the suspects at a Texaco garage before the incident, and a video of Mr Pearce playing pool, werealso released by the Metropolitan Police today. Grieving mother Jan Pearce, 63, said: 'It has been just over four months since my Danny was randomly murdered in Greenwich. 'He left behind a family who loved him unconditionally, including two sisters and a brother. But it is not only us as adults suffering. 'Danny's nieces and nephews are grieving and it hurts them in different ways. How do you answer a child when they ask where Uncle Danny is? 'We need to get these murderers off the street - who knows who will be next and then another family will go through the same devastation as us? 'If you know who did this to my son please, please tell the police. I don't want another mum to go through this agony. I need to know those responsible will be locked up for a very long time.' Crimestoppers have announced a 10,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Detective Inspector Jo Sidaway said: 'Danny's mother Jan has been very brave in speaking out in public for the first time about the terrible crime that took the life of her son. 'We hope her joining forces with us to support this new appeal will encourage anyone who has not already come forward to contact us as soon as possible.
