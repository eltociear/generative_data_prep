{"prompt": "NLP lacks a central body able to speak for the field. Instead it has respected voices and a range of associations and practitioner bodies. Since the 1990s, various individuals and groups have attempted to address this, and in some countries NLP is professionally respected, however the field as a whole has historically lacked a firm disciplinary structure. The British 'Association for NLP' is an example of one such body, whose professional structure includes: In 1994 the ANLP's Professional and Counselling Services was awarded a representative on the Governing Board of the UK Council for Psychotherapy, the regulatory body for psychotherapy in the UK.[46] The ANLP comments that it received above average scrutiny and skepticism before being accepted.[47] Can you decide the sentiment polarity of the paragraph? 'Positive', 'Negative' or 'Neutral'?", "completion": "Neutral"}

{"prompt": " A case for a 2019 10th Gen Kindle that has a lightMy kid loves her ancient Kindle, but it's failing. I got her a 2019 10th Gen on super-sale. She doesn't care for the back-light and prefers the light on her old Kindle case that shines on the screen. The problem is... who would make a case with a light for a Kindle that has a back-lighting feature? I'm guessing nobody. I mean... why would they? I looked and found nothing. I'm posting on the off chance that someone might know of one. Then we'd have the best of both worlds. Many thanks for any advice.", "completion": "Nope no such case, she'll have to use a clip light.\n\nMaybe replace the battery in the old Kindle? Thank you very much for confirming my suspicions and replying so quickly. I wish it were just the battery... the USB port is loosie-goosie and you have your hold your mouth right to get it to work. There's also damage to the screen and body. She's 16 and has had it since she was just a little girl. (I think that's part of it too; there's sentimental attachment to it which makes switching to a new device difficult even if it might actually be better.) Have you considered buying her favorite model again second hand? Ebay and the Unclaimed Baggage website both occasionally have gently used older models. Then, you could use the case she already has and even though it wouldn't be exactly the same, it might still feel the same! (I personally highly recommend the Unclaimed Baggage store, I've bought two Kindles from them recently, and their devices have been checked over and reset and all to make sure they're in good condition! The only downside is you may have to check the site several times and wait until they have your preferred model.) "}

{"prompt": "The Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) is a proposed extension to the IceCube detector. The design of PINGU would augment the existing 86 strings with an additional 40 with the main goal of determining the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Preliminary studies of the NMO can start with IceCube/DeepCore, a sub-array of more densely- packed strings in operation since 2011. This detector has a neutrino energy threshold of roughly 10 GeV and allows for high-statistics datasets of atmospheric neutrinos to be collected. This data provides a unique opportunity to better understand the systematic effects involved in making the NMO measurement by comparing the simulation studies to real data. These proceedings will present the current status of these studies in Monte Carlo simulations with projected DeepCore sensitivity for the NMO. The preceding text is an abstract of a paper, what might the title of this paper be? 'Neutrino Mass Ordering Studies with PINGU and IceCube/DeepCore', 'Magnetization in short-period mesoscopic electron systems', 'On a Surface Pencil with a Common New Type of Special Suface Curve in Galilean Space G3', 'Disk Masses and Dust Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks Around Brown Dwarfs', 'Decentralized Deterministic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning', 'Disentangling the circumnuclear environs of Centaurus A: II. On the nature of the broad absorption line', 'Characterization of the Very Low Mass Secondary in the GJ 660.1AB System', 'Torsion Degrees of Freedom in the Regge Calculus as Dislocations on the Simplicial Lattice' or 'Superfluids and Supersolids on Frustrated 2D Lattices'?", "completion": "Neutrino Mass Ordering Studies with PINGU and IceCube/DeepCore"}
