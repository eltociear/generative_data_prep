{"prompt": "The below report was drawn up following a debate on the Cuba page over whether the article should carry the statement \"Cuba is the only state in the Western Hemisphere that is not a democracy\" in the articles opening section. It is to illustrate the very broad meaning of the term \"democracy\" and to establish that there is a significant and verifiable belief that Cuba employs certain democratic practices. The information is arranged in order to question whether the statement should be given without citation, context and some counter argument. Judge the sentiment of the text. You can choose from 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Neutral'.", "completion": "Neutral"}

{"prompt": "Short time after the official launch of WiFi 6, IEEE 802.11 working groups are already designing its successor in the wireless local area network (WLAN) ecosystem: WiFi 7. With the IEEE 802.11be amendment as one of its main constituent parts, future WiFi 7 aims to include time-sensitive networking (TSN) capabilities to support low latency and ultra reliability in license-exempt spectrum bands. This article first introduces the key features of IEEE 802.11be, which are then used as the basis to discuss how TSN functionalities could be implemented in WiFi 7. Finally, benefits and requirements of the most representative low-latency use cases for WiFi 7 are reviewed. What's this text about?", "completion": "Computer Science"}

{"prompt": "We calculate, via spin density functional theory (SDFT) and exact diagonalization, the eigenstates for electrons in a variety of external potentials, including double and triple dots. The SDFT calculations employ realistic wafer profiles and gate geometries and also serve as the basis for the exact diagonalization calculations. The exchange interaction J between electrons is the difference between singlet and triplet ground state energies and reflects competition between tunneling and the exchange matrix element, both of which result from overlap in the barrier. For double dots, a characteristic transition from singlet ground state to triplet ground state (positive to negative J) is calculated. For the triple dot geometry with 2 electrons we also find the electronic structure with exact diagonalization. For larger electron number (18 and 20) we use only SDFT. In contrast to the double dot case, the triple dot case shows a quasi-periodic fluctuation of J with magnetic field which we attribute to periodic variations of the basis states in response to changing flux quanta threading the triple dot structure.

{"prompt": " Danger Dark World Deck AdviceIm looking for any improvement for the deck/tips on playing it. Not sure if going first or second is what you want with it. With cyber stein, and Appolusa with Naturia on board turn one, I usually just get an insta scoop (toxic, I know) \n\nI\u2019m just not sure if I should aim to go first or second? Any advice or card replacements would be greatly appreciated! I know that this isn\u2019t a tier 1, or probably even tier 2 deck, but having a blast playing it and love rougeish decks\n\nLastly, sorry for the four pics. This is my mobile account.", "completion": "I do enjoy danger dark world. It fun. You can try using Ceruli, Guru of Dark World\n\nIf discarded via Card effect like any other Dark world monster you can special summon 8t to you opponent field and discard one card . That will trigger the second effect of Dark world monsters. \nGrapha will randomly target a card in opponent hand and if it a monster you can special summon it.\nSillva will make you opponent put 2 cards from there hands in the bottom of their deck \nSnoww will special summon a monster from you opponent GY. And you can reuse these effect as long as you take back your Ceruli vie Security Dragon link 2 monster while co-linked you can target 1 card on either players field and return it to hand.\n\nIf you want you can easily OTK with number 100 numeron dragon. You can special summon it using number 97: draglubion effect. You only need 2 level 8 on the field to do it.\n\nAnother good card imo is Coach King Giantrainer. It needs 3 level 8 and can draw up to 3 cards but you can't attack this turn. For each monster you draw using it effect. It bruns the opponent for 600.\n\n\nThis deck can almost make every thing .. if you want a good tuners you can check the fabled cards they special summon themselves if discarded.\n\nOne other level 4 engine is the raiders knight and arc rebellion xyz dragon.\nIt can otk going second if summoned.\n\n\nI hope this was a bit helpful.\nHave fun dueling with this deck it's fun. I\u2019m having a blast with it, thanks!  Will look into some of there strategies! X "}

{"prompt": " Bit of a long post, so I'll try to spare readers some pain by putting **emphasis** on the important parts.\n\nI made a post sometime (last year?) and have refined my information quite a bit since then, sometimes through research and correction and sometimes due to changes in immigration policies. The short of it is, I am looking to move to south America and, at this time, am mostly looking at Colombia, Ecuador and Per\u00fa.\n\nColombia and Ecuador have very straightforward processes: buy real estate or invest money, live there, eventually acquire citizenship. Per\u00fa, not so much, which is why **Per\u00fa is the one I'm seeking information about in this post**.\n\nBecause I am retiring, I am not looking to work, which is both an advantage (I have access to visas that don't allow working) and a disadvantage (work visas are out). Their residency by investment program is highly impractical (you can't just invest, you have to create a business and hire at least five employees), so that option is out.\n\n**They do have a \"rentista\" visa where you need to prove an income of 1k USD per month.** This is the visa I'm interested in, but I am having a hard time finding details about it.\n\nAccording to the government site, the income needs to be permanent and there needs to be an accredited document proving it. I'll copy the two relevant sections here, the first is if the income source is in Per\u00fa and the second is if it's from outside of the country.\n\n&gt; Copia simple del documento que acredite la percepci\u00f3n de la renta permanente mensual por parte del solicitante.\n\n&gt; Copia simple del documento del pa\u00eds de donde proviene la renta que acredite que el solicitante percibe un ingreso neto permanente m\u00ednimo de mil d\u00f3lares mensuales.\n\nIf the money comes from outside, you also have to make a legal statement declaring that it's from a legit source.\n\n&gt; Declaraci\u00f3n jurada que se\u00f1ale que el dinero ingresa al Per\u00fa a trav\u00e9s de una entidad bancaria o financiera bajo la supervisi\u00f3n de la Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP-SBS.\n\nI'm assuming that the thousand dollars they're talking about is USD.\n\n**Basically, the concerns I have are:**\n\n1. What types of investments would qualify?\n\n2. What kind of accreditation would they accept?\n\n3. Does the amount just need to be 1k USD forever?\n\nThese are relatively simple questions, but in practice, it translates into a bit of a mess. For example...\n\n1. I get a non-indexed life annuity for 1k USD a month. Would that qualify as permanent income?\n\n2. Would Peruvian authorities accept official documentation from the financial institution as \"accredited\" or would they just say it's impossible for them to verify if my annuity is legit unless I use a financial institution in Per\u00fa?\n\n3. If they increase the amount up from 1k USD a month and happen to do so before I'm a citizen, does that only apply to new visa applicants or do I have to invest more into my annuity to raise the monthly amount?\n\nThese are the kind of dumb details that can ruin an application process, and if I invest my money in an annuity, I'm not sure I'd be able to withdraw it and use it for investment visas in another country.\n\n**I'm also open to suggestions**, is there a particular approach you would take here?", "completion": "Tough questions, I know. Figured it was a long shot and, given that almost three thousand people saw this and no one could answer, it really was. \n\nEmigration is difficult, it's no wonder so few people ever get to do it.\n\nGuess I'll have to talk to some immigration lawyers, unfortunately they are notoriously unreliable in Latin America.
