I hesitated for a long time on buying either the P2 or P4. But now that I have them, I would not trade them. I'd say go for it if you are a collector or if you want the flipping action. If it was just to get work done, I'd stick with the Wave or Rebar personally.

{"prompt": "We consider a problem in which two players interact in a zero-sum game repeatedly. The payoff matrix of the game is unknown to the players a priori, and may change arbitrarily on each round. Our objective is to find competitive strategies that can achieve the Nash equilibrium of the game with the average payoffs in the long term. This problem is a significant extension of the classical learning setting in zero-sum games, where the underlying payoff matrix is often assumed to be fixed or i.i.d. In contrast, we allow the payoff matrix to evolve arbitrarily in each round, and can even be selected in a possibly adversarial fashion. Zero-sum games [44, 53] are ubiquitous in economics and central to understanding Linear Programming duality [4, 31] , convex optimization [1, 3] , robust optimization [11] , and Differential Privacy [22] . The task of finding the Nash equilibrium of a zero-sum game is also connected to several machine learning problems such as: Markov Games [40] , Boosting [26] , Multiarmed Bandits with Knapsacks [9, 34] and dynamic pricing problems [23] . We formally define the problem setting in Section 1.1. We then highlight the main contributions of this paper in Section 1.2 and discuss related works in Section 1.3. Generate a summary for the text.", "completion": "We study the problem of repeated play in a zero-sum game in which the payoff matrix may change, in a possibly adversarial fashion, on each round; we call these Online Matrix Games. Finding the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a two player zero-sum game is core to many problems in statistics, optimization, and economics, and for a fixed game matrix this can be easily reduced to solving a linear program. But when the payoff matrix evolves over time our goal is to find a sequential algorithm that can compete with, in a certain sense, the NE of the long-term-averaged payoff matrix. We design an algorithm with small NE regret--that is, we ensure that the long-term payoff of both players is close to minimax optimum in hindsight. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence with respect to the number of rounds and depends poly-logarithmically on the number of available actions of the players. Additionally, we show that the naive reduction, where each player simply minimizes its own regret, fails to achieve the stated objective regardless of which algorithm is used. We also consider the so-called bandit setting, where the feedback is significantly limited, and we provide an algorithm with small NE regret using one-point estimates of each payoff matrix."}
