{"prompt": " All members of TWICE have renewed their contract with JYP Entertainment", "completion": "Such great news! I'll admit there were more than a couple of members that I really didn't think would renew if you'd asked me a few months ago but it did become pretty clear recently that they'd all re-signed IMO.\n\nI'm glad JYP have properly announced it too. I don't think SM ever made any statement at all about Red Velvet lol *Allegedly*, SM makes their artists sign an automatic 3 year extension after the initial 7 years finish which would be where Red Velvet is right now (all alleged since this came from Jessica's book but it feels way too specific \ud83e\udd28).\n\nEXO being the exception here since they had flat 10 year contracts because SM exploited a loophole It's weird SM didn't even announce it and we just moved on when Red Velvet is still making music as a group beyond their seven-year period. Will renewal talks be bigger news when that 3 years extension is up? Hard to say? SNSD did make it past the 7 year mark and then well .... it was a mess after \ud83d\ude2d (tbh same for f(x) but at least Red Velvet are still releasing music as a group and seem to want to be together) "}

{"prompt": " Can a pine apple make your vagina smell good?", "completion": "Use a soap with a pH as close as possible to the body\u00b4s own: ask for this at a pharmacy. No perfume. Wash it no more then once a day and never use soap inside. The vagina itself is self-cleaning and if you use soap you can make the atmosphere more inclined to get infections. A vagina naturally has its own smell which is normal. They are supposed to. If it smells like rotten fish you have a infection and need to see a doctor. The smell can also vary depending on where you are in your cycle. Also think about what you wear. Clothes that are too tight leave no air and same if you remove all pubic hair. The hair is there to control the temperature. Sleep with no underwear on to make it breathe so to speak. Swimming is a good natural way."}

{"prompt": " How does a doctor measure your pulse by taking it at your wrist?", "completion": "Doctors can measure and assess the pulse or heart rate from many sites on the body. The radial pulse is located in the wrist, on the inner arm above the thumb; there is no pulse on the pinkie side. The radial pulse is the most common assessment, done as part of \"TPR\" - temperature, pulse, and respiration. It is easy to access, easy to perform the assessment, and gives a quick indication of heart function. For example, if a 20-year old's pulse was 150, the doctor would want to find out why. The apical pulse is the second most common site to assess the heart rate. The location is just to the left of the nipple on a man, and the same place on a woman but up under the breast tissue. This site allows a medical person to hear the heart at it's source, the heart. Cardiologists also listen to the heart and lungs at different places over the entire chest and back. Although the other sites are not \"pulses\", the ascultation (listening to) at the other sites can help assess health or illness. The carotid pulse is in the neck. one on each side of the neck over the carotid artery. This assessment can alert a physician if blood flow is decreased on one or both sides. The testing is important, especially in heart disease, because the carotid arteries deliver all oxygenated blood to the brain. The femoral artery is in the groin, one coming down into each thigh. This is the main artery feeding oxygenated blood to the legs and feet. These may be assessed if the patient has a blood clot in the legs or groin. The femoral arteries' sites are also one of the last pulses a medical person can hear as a person is dying. A doctor may also feel for the femoral-politeal area behind each knee. As well, each foot has a pulse. This assessment is important anytime a patient has impaired circulation of the legs/feet, or has significant swelling, or has a broken leg / ankle or foot."}
