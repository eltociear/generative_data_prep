{"prompt": " What's the deal with #saveminecraft?", "completion": "Answer: An upcoming update to Minecraft, 1.19.1, is making a major change in procedure to their social moderation/chat reporting system. In an effort to cut down on hate speech and harassment, Minecraft is changing their reporting system to allow player bans on all servers - even private ones. Effectively if someone gets reported for their behavior and receives a ban, they are banned from not only that server but any and all servers, thus allowing them only to play offline. This has sparked quite a bit of blowback from the community; while many will say that they agree with additional moderation in principle, they believe banning accounts from all online servers (even private ones) is going too far. The idea being that people should be able to do what they want on private servers, and not have their access to private servers be terminated because they get reported on public ones. Thus the hashtag #saveminecraft is being used to pressure Mojang to reconsider the new policy. \n\nThis also comes on the tail end of forcing users who had Java accounts to make Microsoft accounts, and stopping players who only had Mojang accounts from being able to play on servers. So to some it feels like a variety of changes that might make things easier for Microsoft to manage Mojang and its properties, but are a hassle for players and potentially could see them unable to continue playing online if they refuse to go along with the changes. People don't like change unless it benefits them, and nothing here has seemed beneficial to players. \n\nOriginally scheduled to go live June 28th, the 1.19.1 update has been pushed back to an unspecified date. The 1.19.1 update is live as far as I know. "}

{"prompt": " Is judge made law better than statute?", "completion": "Statutes are enacted as bills through the legislature. Case law, or judicially created law, is normally the application of the particular statute to a particular set of facts. Case law is also created when there is no statute on point. For example, if my state has a statute that says \"it is unlawful to operate a vehicle without wearing a seatbelt\" and then I get a ticket for driving my tractor with no seatbelt, the judge must examine the statute, and determine whether or not it applies to the particular situation. Of course, this is an oversimplified example, but the idea is that the legislature cannot anticipate every possible future circumstance, so they draft broad laws, and the courts then determine how the law should be applied in each situation."}

{"prompt": "A fundamental question in machine learning is to determine what a model can and cannot learn. In deep learning, there has been significant research effort in establishing positive results for feedforward (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Lu et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Neto et al., 1997) , as well as more recently for Transformers and Neural GPUs (Prez et al., 2019) . We have also seen the first results studying the universality of graph neural networks, i.e., neural networks that take graphs as input. Maron et al. (2019b) derived a universal approximation theorem over invariant functions targeted towards deep networks whose layers are linear and equivariant to permutation of their input. Universality was also shown for equivariant functions and a particular shallow architecture (Keriven & Peyr, 2019) . Universality statements allow us to grasp the expressive power of models in the limit. In theory, given enough data and the right training procedure, a universal network will be able to solve any task that it is presented with. Nevertheless, the insight brought by such results can also be limited. Knowing that a sufficiently large network can be used to solve any problem does not reveal much about how neural networks should be designed in practice. It also cannot guarantee that said network will be able to solve a given task given a particular training procedure, such as stochastic gradient descent. On the other hand, it might be easier to obtain insights about models by studying their limitations. After all, the knowledge of what cannot be computed (and thus learned) by a network of specific characteristics applies independently of the training procedure. Further, by helping us comprehend the difficulty of a task in relation to a model, impossibility results can yield practical advice on how to select model hyperparameters. Take, for instance, the problem of graph classification. Training a graph classifier entails identifying what constitutes a class, i.e., finding properties shared by graphs in one class but not the other, and then deciding whether new graphs abide to said learned properties. However, if the aforementioned decision problem is shown to be impossible by a graph neural network of certain depth then we can be certain that the same network will not learn how to classify a sufficiently diverse test set correctly, independently of which learning algorithm is employed. We should, therefore, focus on networks deeper that the lower bound when performing experiments. Table 1 : Summary of main results. Subgraph verification* entails verifying one of the following predicates for a given subgraph: is connected, contains a cycle, forms a spanning tree, is bipartite, is a cut, is an s-t cut. All problems are defined in Appendix A. Please write a summary of about 134 words based on the previous article.", "completion": "This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks falling within the message-passing framework (GNNmp). Two results are presented. First, GNNmp are shown to be Turing universal under sufficient conditions on their depth, width, node attributes, and layer expressiveness. Second, it is discovered that GNNmp can lose a significant portion of their power when their depth and width is restricted. The proposed impossibility statements stem from a new technique that enables the repurposing of seminal results from distributed computing and leads to lower bounds for an array of decision, optimization, and estimation problems involving graphs. Strikingly, several of these problems are deemed impossible unless the product of a GNNmp's depth and width exceeds a polynomial of the graph size; this dependence remains significant even for tasks that appear simple or when considering approximation."}
