{"prompt": "According to the World Health Organization's program of cancer control, more than 40% of cancer cases can be prevented, and even larger percentage can be cured if early detected [1] . To this end, one of the key practices to be implemented and made a medical routine is an early detection of small lesions and widespread monitoring of functionality of organs. Realization of these objectives requires that an accurate and frequent, non-invasive medical examinations are made available to wide public. Persistent efforts in this direction are being continuously undertaken and are devoted to inventing still better resolution and cheaper medical scanning detectors. As an obvious consequence of detectors' refinement in precision and speed, dealing with data streams coming out of these equipments, or needed to simulate and optimize them, by far exceed earlier experience. This situation has already been observed earlier in high-energy physics and astrophysics, where new generation of detectors and data acquisition electronics was introduced one or two decades ago. Also in medicine it becomes clear that in order to handle efficiently growing streams of data, one has to equip both the detector developers and medical teams with fast data processing and digital image reconstruction methods and services. In this paper we outline major computational problems related to data analysis and imaging. After formulation of these problems in terms of information technologies, we discuss some real-life solutions. In addition to its purely technical side, the problem has other aspects, as e.g. requirements of medical data protection. We outline the program of research and prospective service support in medical image processing for the novel solution of the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) based on the plastic Time of Flight (TOF) detector being developed at the Jagiellonian University [2] . This research and support program in the information technology domain is foreseen, both in the near and more distant future, as a major task for the Computing Centre CI at the National Centre for Nuclear Research [3] . What is the previous article about? Please summarize in about 41 words.", "completion": "We discuss computing issues for data analysis and image reconstruction of PET-TOF medical scanner or other medical scanning devices producing large volumes of data. Service architecture based on the grid and cloud concepts for distributed processing is proposed and critically discussed."}
{"prompt": " cant ollie for my life. any tips?", "completion": "You're bending at the waist/hips instead of the knees. That's keeping you from jumping and popping like you should and throwing you off balance. Keep your head even with the balls of your feet like a triangle as you crouch. Jump off your back foot, keeping your front knee bent up towards you, then bring your back foot up as you level out the board with your front. A good tip I've found recently about timing is think of the pop and the level-out as a heartbeat. Bum-bump. Pop-slide. Hope that makes sense and helps at least a little. Thanks, will keep this in mind for tomorrow. Nice, let me know if it helps! Just tried these tips. The knees thing solved almost all my problems. Although I will need to practice the heartbeat and jumping with my back foot. Thanks so much! Hell yeah dude! This made my day. I still have trouble with the timing myself, I'm pretty sure it's just a matter of practice. Yes practice is definetly key. "}
