{"prompt": "A fisherman has stunned beachgoers by wrestling with a shark he had caught to make sure it got safely back into the ocean. The fisherman was filmed wrestling his massive catch on North Beach, 16 kilometres from Perth's CBD, in front of a large crowd. Lidija Miles saw the commotion as she was on her morning run, causing her to stop and capture the bizarre moment on video. Onlookers saw the fisherman had caught something big on his line, but were unaware it was a shark until it came to shore,Perth Nowreported. 'We didn't know what it was but as it came closer we could see it was a shark,' Mrs Miles said. Footage shows the man attempting to remove his lure from the shark as it dangerously thrashes around in his arms. After removing his lure, a group of men come to the fisherman's aid in attempting to push the shark back out to sea. Finally, a man hesitantly wraps his arms around the shark and with the help of waves, guides it into the ocean. He then follows the shark as it swims into deeper water, as a paddler gave the all clear to ensure the shark swam back out to sea. Mrs Miles said the experience was 'beautiful' and a moment she would never forget. 'It was a really heartwarming moment when he dragged it back, he was so calm and very respectful towards the shark. There was a nice sigh of relief from everyone,' she said. When summarizing this text, would you mention 'Another man then put his arm around the shark and pushed it back into the sea' before 'Fisherman stunned beachgores by wrestling a shark he caught on his fishing reel'? 'Yes' or 'No'?", "completion": "No"}
{"prompt": " Am 19 years old when is your body gonna go through a change?", "completion": "If you average all the cells as they live, multiply, and die, many sources say that it takes seven years for all of them to change in your body. This is somewhat true, but also somewhat misleading. The truth is that different cells have different lifespans. For example, the nerve cells in your brain do not multiply and they last for your entire life. If any of them die, they do not get replaced. At the other end of the spectrum are the white blood cells in your body. They have the shortest lifespan and some of them live only a few days. So, in actuality, the concept that your body changes every seven years is not exactly true, because even though most of your body cells will have reproduced and replaced themselves, not all of them have, and some have replaced themselves many times over during those seven years."}

{"prompt": "Although great advancements in psychiatric research have been made in recent years, an explanatory gap between phenomenological entities and neurobiological underpinnings remains (Montague et al., 2012) . This gap has prevented precise diagnosis and dramatic improvements in treatment outcomes in the field of clinical psychiatry (Insel and Cuthbert, 2015) . Our lack of understanding of the disease mechanisms is reflected by the fact that the two worldwide standard psychiatric diagnosis systems-the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organization, 1990 )-adopt symptom-based approaches, in which underlying biological substrates are not taken into consideration (Insel and Cuthbert, 2009) , except in the case of dementia. Consequently, these symptom-based diagnostic systems may artificially draw distinctions among conditions that actually share common biological etiologies, and therefore, may fail to provide effective biology-based treatments directed toward specific pathogenic processes associated with these conditions (Owen, 2014) . Therefore, the recent initiative of research domain criteria (RDoC) has proposed an important paradigm shift from the conventional symptom-based categories to data-driven dimensional approaches based on observable behaviors and neurobiological measures (Insel and Cuthbert, 2009) , with the aim of eliminating the gap between disease-related behaviors and neurobiological substrates. In this review, we first explain that brain functional measures provided by fMRI, particularly the restingstate functional connectivity (rs-fc) MRI, play crucial roles for the development of \"biomarkers\" that provide dimensions along which various psychiatric disorders could be defined. Then, we illustrate the potential and power of the fMRI-and biomarker-based neurofeedback methods in the treatments of disease-related behaviors. By illustrating the development of rs-fcMRI-based biomarkers and fMRI-based neurofeedback, we claim that these two lines of new research converge in filling the abovementioned gap. In around 236 words, briefly describe what the previous paragraph talks about.", "completion": "Psychiatric research has been hampered by an explanatory gap between psychiatric symptoms and their neural underpinnings, which has resulted in poor treatment outcomes. This situation has prompted us to shift from symptom-based diagnosis to data-driven diagnosis, aiming to redefine psychiatric disorders as disorders of neural circuitry. Promising candidates for data-driven diagnosis include resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI)-based biomarkers. Although biomarkers have been developed with the aim of diagnosing patients and predicting the efficacy of therapy, the focus has shifted to the identification of biomarkers that represent therapeutic targets, which would allow for more personalized treatment approaches. This type of biomarker (i.e., theranostic biomarker) is expected to elucidate the disease mechanism of psychiatric conditions and to offer an individualized neural circuit-based therapeutic target based on the neural cause of a condition. To this end, researchers have developed rs-fcMRI-based biomarkers and investigated a causal relationship between potential biomarkers and disease-specific behavior using functional MRI (fMRI)-based neurofeedback on functional connectivity. In this review, we introduce recent approach for creating a theranostic biomarker, which consists mainly of two parts: (i) developing an rs-fcMRI-based biomarker that can predict diagnosis and/or symptoms with high accuracy, and (ii) the introduction of a proof-of-concept study investigating the relationship between normalizing the biomarker and symptom changes using fMRI-based neurofeedback. In parallel with the introduction of recent studies, we review rs-fcMRI-based biomarker and fMRI-based neurofeedback, focusing on the technological improvements and limitations associated with clinical use."}
