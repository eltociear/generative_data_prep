{"prompt": "Ahmad of Madagascar pulled off a stunning upset on Thursday, ousting Issa Hayatou, the long-serving president of the Confederation of African Football, in an election at the organisation's congress in Ethiopia. The 57-year-old former government minister, who goes by just a single name, won the CAF presidency by 34 votes to 20 in the poll, bringing to a surprise end the 29-year tenure of the 70-year-old Hayatou, who is from Cameroon. The result was greeted by cheers at the CAF Congress as Ahmad was carried on the shoulders of jubilant supporters to the podium after the result was announced. Ahmad, previously minister of sport and minister of fisheries in his home country, had been given little chance just a month ago when he announced his candidacy. But he offered voters a fresh face to a younger generation of football association presidents that have emerged. Hayatou's long career in football is now at an end, although he is still an International Olympic Committee member. 'It is not that bad,' Hayatou, who was first elected in 1988, told reporters as he departed the hall. Given the events: 'Ahmad of Madagascar pulled off a stunning victory by 34 votes to Hayatou's 20', 'Issa Hayatou was president of the Confederation of African Football for 29 years', 'As he left the hall in Ethiopia, Hayatou noted to reporters: 'It's not that bad'', which one came right after 'On Thursday, he was ousted at an election at the organisation's congress' according to the text?", "completion": "Ahmad of Madagascar pulled off a stunning victory by 34 votes to Hayatou's 20"}

{"prompt": "\"A Mind Beside Itself\" is a three-part song cycle composed of \"Erotomania\", \"Voices\" and \"The Silent Man\". Portnoy stated that the instrumental \"Erotomania\" was written \"off the cuff\"as \"a bit of a joke and parody\". Petrucci penned the lyrics to \"Voices\", dealing with the subject of mental illness. He researched schizophrenia and similar disorders and used religious terms \"to make things more vivid\". \"When I was writing it, I saw these terms and medical things that were just brilliant,\" he said. \"Like there was a guy who felt that his skin was inside out. I read that and was like 'Oh my God! That's unbelievable; I've got to write about that.'\" Petrucci wrote the music and lyrics to the acoustic \"The Silent Man\". LaBrie described the lyrics as dealing with \"communication breakdown, for instance between a father and a son. We feel that we have to play certain roles when around one of our parents, and we never really get to know the real person. I'm lucky that I behave with my own father like I would a friend. We can joke around and go for a beer.\" A full live performance of the suite can be found on the 2000 \"Live Scenes from New York\" album.\"Skylark\" is an American popular song with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Hoagy Carmichael, published in 1941. Mercer said that he struggled for a year after he got the music from Carmichael before he could get the lyrics right. Mercer recalled Carmichael initially called him several times about the lyric, but had forgotten about it by the time Mercer finally wrote the lyrics. The yearning expressed in the lyrics is Mercer's longing for Judy Garland, with whom Mercer had an affair.\"The Wind Cries Mary\" is a rock ballad written by Jimi Hendrix. According to his then girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham's, account, he wrote the lyrics after an argument with her, using \"Mary\" (Etchingham's middle name). In a later interview, Hendrix commented that the lyrics represent \"more than one person\".Ioanna-Maria Gertsou was born on January 20, 1979 in Athens Greece and she is visually impaired due to retinopathy of prematurity. She is mostly known as representative of the guide dog movement, through \"Lara Guide-Dog School Hellas\" a non - profit organisation that she co-founded in 2008. She is an activist, promoting human diversity, guide dog access, physical and electronic accessibility and animal rights. She is also a scientist with superior studies in experimental psychology and cognitive science. From 2006 to 2012, she worked as a researcher in the Human/computer Interaction Laboratory, located at the Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas (F.O.R.T.H.) which is considered to be a major scientific center worldwide. In 2008, during a visit at F.O.R.T.H the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias was moved by her presentation and did something extraordinary: he bowed and kissed her hand to show his respect. Ioanna-Maria is one among the very few visually impaired / disabled researchers around the world and the only one, employed in Greece. Additionally, she is considered to be a rare case of a person who is blind since birth to exhibit visual synaesthesia. That is why, she is being asked to contribute to experiments, studies and projects regarding perception and the crossing of the senses. Every year, she is invited and participates in numerous conferences, arising matters varying from psychological research to guide dogs and contemporary issues as youth unemployment., Her knoweledge in psychology is often shared on newspapers and blogs. She was the first person to enter with her guide dog (and a dog in general), into the Hellenic Parliament and the European Parliament. In 2009, she protested through the web because her guide dog was denied in two reustaurants. She wrote a letter which went viral and caused great awareness. Following this incident, one year later a Spanish tourist named Antonia Pons Losada was not permitted into the new Acropolis Museum with her guide dog. As a result of local and international outcry regarding issues of guide dog access in Greece on August 2010, Ioanna contributed to the voting of the first national law, related to guide dogs. As soon as the law was approved by the Hellenic Parliament, she took her guide dog \"May\" and a Television crew for a visit to the Acropolis Museum. Today on the Museum's website we are informed that \"guide and assistance dogs, are welcome\". According to the law 3868/2010, guide, assistance and therapy dogs are allowed practically everywhere in Greece. The law was recently reviewed, including guide/assistance/therapy dogs who are still in training and claryfing that they can enter into transportation means, without a muzzle. While transforming Greece into a role model for guide dog access, she joined the board of directors of the European Guide Dog Federation to defend the rights and access of guide dog teams, throughout the European Union. In 2013 at the European Parliament, she and former MEP Jorgo Chatzimarkakis were the main rapporteurs for the voting of an E.U. direction, aiming to promote e-accessibility on governmental websites. The direction was approved in 2014. Ioanna-Maria, was two times a political candidate. One in the 2009 Hellenic National Elections with the Ecogreens Party and one in the 2014 European Elections with the \"Greek European Citizens Party\". She was a paracycling athlete. Always accompanied by her two guide dogs \"Lara\" and \"May\", she had appeared on several documentaries, TV shows, movies and public events., The references are mainly in Greek.\"Chaar Kadam\" (English: Four Steps) is a romantic Hindi song from the 2014 Bollywood film, \"PK\". Composed by Shantanu Moitra, the song is sung by Shaan and Shreya Ghoshal, with lyrics penned by Swanand Kirkire. The music video of the track features actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Anushka Sharma.\"Ricochet\" (sometimes rendered \"Rick-o-Shay\" and also as \"Ricochet Romance\") is a popular song. The credits show it to be written by Larry Coleman, Joe Darion, and Norman Gimbel, without apportioning the work on the lyrics and music, in 1953. In fact, since Coleman and Darion wrote \"Changing Partners\" the same year, with Darion as lyricist and Coleman as composer, while Gimbel wrote the English lyric for \"Sway\" the same year, it can be concluded that Coleman wrote the music and Darion and Gimbel the lyrics.Swanand Kirkire (Marathi: \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u093f\u0930\u0915\u093f\u0930\u0947) (born 1970) is an Indian lyricist, playback singer, writer, assistant director and dialogue writer, both in television and Hindi films.James Church Alvord was an American poet who flourished in the early years of the 20th century. A handful of his poems were published in Poetry Magazine, and are available in its online archives. Others appeared in general magazines such as \"The Nation\" and \"The Century Magazine\". In addition, the libretto he wrote for a \"Sc\u00e8ne Dramatique\" by the composer Frederick Stevenson, called \"An American Ace\", is available through the Library of Congress. Before the entry of the United States into the First World War, he published a short story (\"The Iron Cross\") in a collection produced by the Christian Women's Peace Movement, but as the libretto to \"American Ace\" shows, by the end of the war he had adopted a rather different stance. In addition to poetry, he also wrote reviews for the New York Times. In the 1920s someone of the same name was a Professor of Modern Languages at Centenary College of Louisiana, and wrote the lyrics of the college's Alma Mater, but it is not clear whether this was the same person.Sara Jeannette Duncan (22 December 1861\u00a0\u2013 22 July 1922) was a Canadian author and journalist. She also published as Mrs. Everard Cotes among other names. First trained as a teacher in a normal school, she published poetry early in her life and after a brief period of teaching got a job as a travelling writer for Canadian newspapers and wrote a column for \"The Globe\", a Toronto paper. Afterward she wrote for the \"Washington Post\" where she also gained editorial experience, being quickly put in charge of the current literature section. She continued to work as a writer and editor for Canadian publications until a journey to India, where she married an Anglo-Indian civil servant. From then on she divided her time between England and India, writing for publications in various countries, and then began to write fiction rather than journalism. She wrote 22 works of fiction, many with international themes and settings, novels which met with mixed acclaim and today are rarely read. She died in Ashtead, Surrey, England, a year after she moved there with her husband. In 2016, she was named a National Historic Person on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.Kancharla Gopanna (Telugu: \u0c15\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32 \u0c17\u0c4b\u0c2a\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28 ) (c 1620 \u2013 1680), popularly known as Bhakta Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu (Telugu: \u0c2d\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c1a\u0c32 \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c2e\u0c26\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c41 ), was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music.

Other famous \"vaggeyakaras\" in Telugu literature, including Annamayya, Tyagaraja, Kshetrayya, and Shyama Sastri. He lived in the village of Nelakondapalli near Bhadrachalam, Telangana during the 16th century and is renowned for constructing a famous temple for Rama at Bhadrachalam. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as \"Ramadaasu Keertanalu\". Even the doyen of South Indian classical music Saint Tyagaraja learned his musical compositions.

{"prompt": "One of the fundamental goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been to create systems that interact with human users fluently and intelligently, by demonstrating inferencing and reasoning capabilities that would be expected of a human partner. To this end, there has been considerable effort recently to create richer datasets in the area of visual and multimodal question answering and inference (Wu and Mooney, 2018; Hu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017; Antol et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015) . This includes a growing interest in posing larger challenges to end-to-end systems employing architectures with DNNs (Ribeiro et al., 2020; Prabhumoye et al., 2020b) . These moves are encouraging, yet we argue that there should be a greater focus on linguistic and cognitive competencies in the field, and not just on question answering skills or \"challenge checklisting\". There are some moves in this direction already (Johnson et al., 2017) , but there is still no generally accepted distinction in current natural language processing (NLP) between challenge-based tasks and competence-based performance. Analogous to human cognitive competencies, there is both a methodological and modeling advantage to focusing a system's performance on competencebased learning rather than a narrowly defined task or challenge checklist. First we define competencebased learning and testing. While Chomsky (1965) 's distinction between competence and performance has long been debated in linguistics, the term competence-based has been applied to a number of different concepts in both the science of learning and educational communities (Bechtel et al., 1999; Voorhees, 2001; Chyung et al., 2006; Hsiao et al., 2020; Platanios et al., 2019) . The common core to both is a concept capturing a coherent set of abilities that an individual has in a specific domain. When designing a challenge (and the dataset supporting it), we need to distinguish between \"having knowledge of a fact\" and \"testing against the knowledge\": having knowledge of something is worth little if it cannot be retrieved and deployed for a specific task. Hence, both tasks and competencies have an operational component that is missing from abstract knowledge of something. However, there is also an important distinction between taskbased and competence-based behavior. Being able to merely reproduce information does not presppose understanding of the information. However, when we can apply our existing knowledge to new situations, we demonstrate a kind of understanding of how the knowledge (through tasks) is applied. When viewed over a conceptual domain, this constitutes what we will refer to as a competence. A challenge defined in these terms can be called a competence-based challenge. In Section 3, we describe a model of the queries that can be associated with a competence. Section 4 outlines the requirements on a dataset reflecting this distinction and describes such a diagnostic dataset, Recipe-to-Video Questions (R2VQ), designed for testing competence-based comprehension over a multimodal recipe collection. The corpus contains detailed annotation supporting meaning representations required of each question family (Section 5). As a benchmark, we establish baseline evaluation results using several textual and miltimodal statistical leaning methods, and discuss their performance and limitations over the present dataset. Section 6 discusses our findings and future work. Can you express the main content of the text?", "completion": "In this paper, we argue that the design and development of multimodal datasets for natural language processing (NLP) challenges should be enhanced in two significant respects: to more broadly represent commonsense semantic inferences; and to better reflect the dynamics of actions and events, through a substantive alignment of textual and visual information. We identify challenges and tasks that are reflective of linguistic and cognitive competencies that humans have when speaking and reasoning, rather than merely the performance of systems on isolated tasks. We introduce the distinction between challenge-based tasks and competence-based performance, and describe a diagnostic dataset, Recipe-to-Video Questions (R2VQ), designed for testing competence-based comprehension over a multimodal recipe collection (http://r2vq.org/). The corpus contains detailed annotation supporting such inferencing tasks and facilitating a rich set of question families that we use to evaluate NLP systems."}
{"prompt": "Recent years have witnessed great success of deep learning models. Owing to the increasing computation resources and strong model capacity, neural network models have been applied to numerous applications. Among all neural network models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [Williams and Hinton, 1986 ] have shown notable potential on sequence modeling tasks, e.g. speech recognition [Dario et al., 2016] and machine translation [Sutskever et al., 2014] , and therefore receive particular attentions. With increasing explorations on RNN, several variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] , Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [Chung et al., 2015] have been proposed successively. The key advantages of RNN come from the recurrent structures, which carry out the same transition at all time steps, and eventually contribute to a satisfactory performance. Yet this merit may validate under the assumption that all sequences follow the same pattern. The conventional RNN may be inappropriate when processing sequences with multiple patterns. As mentioned in [Goodfellow et al., 2016 ] [Cao et al., 2017 ] [Shazeer et al., 2017] , it is difficult to optimize the network when using the same parameters at all time steps under multiple pattern scenarios. To this end, more adaptive RNN networks are required. Recently, some extended mechanisms on RNN are proposed to augment model capability. The first one is the attention mechanism [Bahdanau et al., 2014] , which is a popular technique in machine translation. The attention mechanism suggests aligning data to capture different patterns when translating different words. Another attractive mechanism is the Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANN) [Weston et al., 2014] , whose basic idea is to setup an external memory to memorize the recent and useful samples. In this paper, instead of aligning to different parts of current input or memorizing specific samples, we introduce a novel mixture layer to memorize principle patterns in training sequences and then align the current state to similar patterns in historical data. In the proposed mixture layer, patterns in training sequences are partitioned into several clusters and their distribution is expressed as a mixture model. Consequently, principle patterns can be represented by prototype vectors of components in the mixture model, i.e. the centers of clusters. When processing input sequences, the mixture layer augmented RNN (termed as M-RNN) first measures similarities between the current state and prototype vectors. Based on these similarities, the probability that current state belongs to each cluster is calculated and we align the current state to historical principle patterns by soft assignments. After that, the state in new M-RNN is adaptively updated according to the assignments, and therefore it is able to assimilate sequences with multiple patterns. In practical situations, some prior or domain knowledge about data is often known beforehand, and our approach is readily to take advantage of that information to further improve the performance. Moreover, although there is a new type of layer added, the proposed M-RNN can still be trained by gradient decent in an end-to-end manner. To summarize, the contributions of our work are as follows:  We introduce a novel mixture layer, which can be interpreted from the mixture model perspective.  By leveraging the mixture layer, we construct M-RNN to adaptively process sequences with multiple patterns.  Our approach can be easily extended by combining the prior knowledge about data. thetic sequences prediction, time series prediction and language modeling. The experimental results demonstrate significant advantages of our M-RNN. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. In Section 3, the mixture layer is introduced in detail, as well as its application on LSTM and combination with prior knowledge. Experimental evaluations are included in Section 4, and final conclusion with looking forward comes in Section 5. Condense the text down to the essentials.", "completion": "Although Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, its performance is inadequate when processing sequences with multiple patterns.

Moreover, our approach can be further extended by taking advantage of prior knowledge about data. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}
