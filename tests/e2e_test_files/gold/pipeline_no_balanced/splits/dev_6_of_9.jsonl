{"prompt": "Star man Cristiano Ronaldo was substituted in the 55th minute for Paulo Dybala. He seemed to be annoyed at Maurizio Sarri's decision to substitute him off. But Sarri insisted afterwards that Ronaldo had an injury and he understood him. Can you write an article that uses the previous text as a summary?", "completion": "Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri has insisted there was 'no problem' withCristiano Ronaldo after the forward was substituted for the second game in a row and walked straight down the tunnel, clearly unhappy at the decision. Ronaldo was taken off in the 55th minute, his earliest substitution since he joined Juve at the start of last season and the first time he has been replaced twice in succession. Sarri's side eventually won the game courtesy of Ronaldo's replacement, Paulo Dybala, who struck in the 77th minute. Despite producing a lacklustre display, Ronaldo gave Sarri a dirty look, muttered something under his breath and walked straight down the tunnel. Afterwards, though, Sarri insisted he understood why the Portuguese forward was annoyed and explained that an injury was behind the decision to take him off. 'We must thank Ronaldo, because he made a sacrifice to be there at all tonight in a difficult situation,'Sarri told Sky Sport Italia. 'He did everything possible to play, but I saw he was not well and thought it best to take him off. 'It's only natural a player is going to be irritated to leave the pitch, especially when he worked so hard to be there. 'Over the last month, he has had this little knee problem, he had a knock in training and it hurt the collateral ligament. 'When he trains at high intensity or plays, it unbalances him, so he ends up overcompensating and it damages the calf and thigh muscles. 'It is affecting his performances and he is not at his best at the moment. 'All players who are trying to give their best will have at least five minutes of being annoyed when they are substituted, but a coach would in general be much more worried if he didn't seem upset.' Ronaldo also looked unhappy after being taken off during Wednesday's Champions League match at Lokomotiv Moscow, although Sarri said it was to avoid risking injury as the 34-year-old had complained of knee and thigh problems. Gazzetta dello Sport said Ronaldo left the stadium before the final whistle on Sunday evening. Juventus, chasing a ninth straight Serie A title and unbeaten in all competitions under Sarri, who took over before the season started, moved to 32 points, a point ahead of Inter Milan who went top after a 2-1 home win over Verona on Saturday."}
{"prompt": "In emergency situations, actions that save lives and limit the impact of hazards are crucial. In order to act, situational awareness is needed to decide what to do. Geolocalized photos and video of the situations as they evolve can be crucial in better understanding them and making decisions faster. Cameras are almost everywhere these days, either in terms of smartphones, installed CCTV cameras, UAVs or others. However, this poses challenges in big data and information overflow. Moreover, most of the time there are no disasters at any given location, so humans aiming to detect sudden situations may not be as alert as needed at any point in time. Consequently, computer vision tools can be an excellent decision support. The number of emergencies where computer vision tools has been considered or used is very wide, and there is a great overlap across related emergency research. Researchers tend to focus on state-of-the-art systems that cover the same emergency as they are studying, obviating important research in other fields. In order to unveil this overlap, the survey is divided along four main axes: the types of emergencies that have been studied in computer vision, the objective that the algorithms can address, the type of hardware needed and the algorithms used. Therefore, this review provides a broad overview of the progress of computer vision covering all sorts of emergencies. Which academic field is this article most likely to be a paper in?", "completion": "Computer Science"}

{"prompt": "Rafael Nadal has been absent from the Shanghai Masters but is guaranteed to recapture the world No 1 spot next month after Novak Djokovic went down to a shock quarter final defeat in China. The 32-year-old Serb, who had looked to be back on his best form, was defeated 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 by 21-year-old Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas on Friday. It means that Nadal, back in Europe with a sore wrist and due to be married, is mathematically assured of regaining the top position on November 4, regardless of what happens in the Paris Masters that takes place the previous week. Roger Federer also went down to a younger player in Shanghai when he suffered an ill-tempered 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 loss to Alex Zverev. Federer was given a point penalty for twice smacking the ball into the crowd in frustration. British No 2 Heather Watson confirmed her best week of a forgettable season when she made the semi-final of the WTA Tianjin Open, also in China, when she beat Poland's Magda Linette 7-5, 6-7, 7-6. The win ought to take her back inside the top 100 and secure her a place in the main draw of the Australian Open next year. Dan Evans, who will officially become the British men's No 1 next week, is to link up with former coach Mark Hilton after he recently left the employment of Kyle Edmund the man Evans has usurped. Edmund has been given a late wildcard into the qualifying event of next week's European Open in Antwerp, where he is the defending champion. He hopes to join Andy Murray and Cam Norrie in the main draw there. In summarizing the previous text, which of the following events should be placed first? 'Rafael Nadal will return to the top of the world tennis rankings next month' or 'Novak Djokovic's shock quarter-final defeat sees Nadal return to the No 1 spot'?", "completion": "Rafael Nadal will return to the top of the world tennis rankings next month"}

Silent Hill 1 and 2 are tied for a spot in the top 3 though, and SH2 is my fav survival horror. \n\nHeavy Rain was so unique to me when it came out. Love it. Will replay again some day.

Is it a legit concern ?", "completion": "During the short months I had the series S, I had occasions where it froze for 5-10 sec. But those happened while navigating he screen and menu, not during gameplay, so yea mine were glitchy a tiny bit but not likely related to overheating.\n\nI know as of 5-6 months ago the standby mode was still not optimized so both my series S and X were running pretty hot on standby. The fams were super slow (as expected), but the walls of the consoles got very noticably warm. It's no longer an issue. "}
