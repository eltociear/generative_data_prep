{"prompt": "'We can't stop our son eating PLASTIC': Parents are pinning their hopes on \u00a37,000 US treatment to stop four-year-old boy with autism from scoffing paper, card and Playdoh Write a news article based on this title.", "completion": "The parents of a boy with autism who eats plastic and cardboard are planning a trip to America to try out a new therapy. Four-year-old Marco Slawycz has little speech and his mum Sara says he's 'totally different to the 'savant' autism types that are so often portrayed in the public' - those with extraordinary skills. His autism affects him in 'numerous ways' - while he has the speech and language skills of an 18-month-old, he has the body and strength of a seven-year-old. Scroll down for video As well as struggling with loud noises and sensory processing, a condition related to his sensory needs - called pica - means he likes to eat non-edibles such as paper, plastic, cardboard and Playdoh. And while a chew stick he's been given meets a lot of his needs, his parents Sara and Bohdan, from Whitefield, have tokeep a very close eye on him to keep him safe. They are hoping that the therapy in America - something that costs 40k a year for a full-time programme in the UK - will improve his speech, language and communication skills, as well as his self care and life skills. They decided to make the 'once in a lifetime' trip after hearing about the therapy offered by Janine Shapiro, a woman they met during a trip to the Bahamas before they even had children. After keeping in touch over via Facebook over the last 10 years Janine,clinical director at Access Behavior Analysis (ABA) in Indianapolis, has invited them over to try it for themselves. The couple, who also have a two-year-old son Lorenz, have been working hard to raise the 7,000 needed to make the trip - with Bohdan, 35, working away as an electrical inspector in Afghanistan for the last nine months to help pay for it. Sara, 33, said: 'We have been invited to meet with her in America and have an amazing opportunity to try this therapy. Although it is available in the UK, it is extremely expensive and not common in schools. 'Marco has completed a term at a Saturday school in Bolton called Autism Support UK which offers a taster of ABA Therapy. They only have 30 places available every six months but he loved it there. 'Indiana is the best place in the world for intensive ABA therapy so this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and Janine is the first dually-certified behavior analyst and speech-language pathologist in the state of Indiana."}
