{"prompt": "The ability to predict ship responses in waves accurately and efficiently is a challenging problem. Ships operate at various speeds and headings and in harsh ocean environments where different wave excitation can lead to severe responses that can harm not only the ship but personnel onboard. Therefore, proper quantification and understanding of the responses due to different wave environments is paramount. Evaluations and predictions are performed by engineers and designers with a variety of numerical hydrodynamic tools. These evaluations can rely on numerical predictions from frequency-domain strip-theory formulations like those developed by Salvesen et al. (1970) , blended nonlinear time-domain methods such as the Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP) (Lin et al., 2007) that leverages a panel method, and TEMPEST (Belknap and Reed, 2019) which utilizes strip-theory to solve the nonlinear hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, as well as sophisticated force models to model green water and viscous effects. More recently, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools with Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) formulations have become more prevalent when predicting ship motions in waves. URANS simulations have been included in the development of force models for potential flow tools like the work of Aram and Silva (2019) , capsizing and broaching in regular waves (Hosseini, 2009; Mousaviraad, 2010) , or within probabilistic frameworks to observe extreme events and calculate the probability of their occurence like the work of Xu et al. (2020) for the Design Loads Generator (DLG) method or Silva and Maki (2021b) for the critical wave groups (CWG) method. A large focus recently has been placed on the prediction of the six degree-of-freedom (DoF) response of vessels in waves where the horizontal plane motions such as surge, sway and yaw can vary greatly. This contrasts with classical seakeeping evaluations, where the vessel is assumed to travel at a constant speed and heading. Previous studies have shown success in predicting 6-DoF motions with URANS simulations (Serani et al., 2021) , while others have employed a potential flow time-domain solution (Lin et al., 2006) , or a hybrid formulation in White et al. (2021) where a URANS double-body formulation and potential flow are combined in a tightly-coupled solver to reduce the computational cost of a volume-of-fluid (VOF) URANS simulation, yet still model some of the important viscous features. Although predictions of 6-DoF ship responses can be made with URANS or potential flow simulations, their computational cost can be prohibitive when long exposure windows are needed or faster than real-time predictions are required for applications such as ship motion forecasting, maneuvering simulators for crew training, and development of control systems. Thus, analyses with these numerical hydrodynamic tools must be performed for many realizations of wave sequences in a nominal seaway to develop a statistical description of the response. A statistical description of the ship response is crucial to design better and safer ships and also to guide the operation of existing platforms away from dangerous situations and towards more favorable ones. However, due to the computational cost of the hydrodynamic tools, evaluations are conducted in nominal seaways and may not be representative of the instantaneous state of the vessel and ocean environment. Though these evaluations provide response statistics based on nominal operating and environmental conditions, they lack the ability to provide the crew upon manned vessels and autonomous systems onboard unmanned vessels with real-time forecasting of ship responses, given the current environment. Accurate forecasting of the vessel's temporal response would allow for both manned and unmanned vessels to operate safer and push the boundaries of their operational envelope with higher confidence as the different sectors of the marine industry push towards more autonomy. The current paper explores the system identification (SI) of a free running ship in waves. SI is used to develop a surrogate model of a complex process. In the context of ship responses in waves, the goal of the SI is to create a fast-running model capable of representing either simulations with a higher-fidelity numerical hydrodynamic tool, model test, or full-scale data. The resulting model can run conditions not considered in its development to expand the analysis to new conditions. In prediction of ship motions in waves, different implementations of SI have been considered, ranging from coefficient-based mathematical models developed in Araki et al. (2019) where parameters were tuned with CFD simulations to neural network-based models. Hess (2007) presented a method with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that attempted to predict the 6-DoF motions of a full-scale ship operating in random waves. Though Hess (2007) was able to produce predictions that were qualitatively similar for some validation cases, larger discrepancies occurred in other cases and overall the RNN model did not produce results that were quantitatively representative of the underlying dynamics. The work of Xu et al. (2021) showcased the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the nonlinear propagation of a wave field downstream of a wave probe as well as the heave and roll of a midship section predicted by CFD. Also, del guila Ferrandis et al. ( 2021 ) applied LSTM and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks to predict motion of vessel traveling at a constant speed and heading. Additionally, LSTM neural networks have been utilized by Silva and Maki (2021a,c) to act as a surrogate for CFD predictions of the extreme roll of a midship section within an the critical wave groups (CWG) extreme event probabilistic method. The work of Xu et al. (2021) ; Silva and Maki (2021a,c); del guila Ferrandis et al. (2021) all showcase the ability of either LSTM or GRU neural networks to represent ship motions due to wave excitation but are limited in that they restrict the DoF in the horizontal plane (surge, sway, and yaw). The case studies in Xu et al. (2021) ; Silva and Maki (2021a,c) were performed at zero speed and constrained sway and yaw, while the case studies in del guila Ferrandis et al. (2021) considered constant speed and heading. Though the assumption of constant speed and heading may be sufficient for some cases, significant variation in the horizontal plane responses can affect the other DoF and overall global response of the vessel. The surrogate models developed through SI techniques can be implemented within a forecasting framework where real-time vessel and wave information can be leveraged to provide faster than real-time predictions of future ship responses. For accurate forecasting predictions, a complete 6-DoF representation of the ship response is required. Recent work by D 'Agostino et al. (2021) compared the ability of different neural network architectures to produce a nowcasting encoder-decoder model capable of predicting a short-term window of the response. Though the models were successful in some DoF, surge and sway produced undesirable results and predictions of all DoF became worse as time increased. Diez et al. (2021) proposed a dynamic mode decomposition method for the forecasting of ship motions but similar to D 'Agostino et al. (2021) , the predictions were close initially but largely drifted as time progressed. The previous work with neural networks has showcased their efficacy when representing simplified ship motions but expansion to a fully free-running ship with implications for nowcasting and forecasting has not been completely developed. The objective of the current work is to extend the work performed in Xu et al. (2021) and develop a modeling approach with an LSTM neural network to represent the 6-DoF response of a vessel in waves accurately and also quantify the uncertainty of the predicted temporal response. The resulting model will not only be suitable for SI but also works within a ship motion forecasting framework. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The proposed modeling approach is illustrated with details about the data-preparation, neural network architecture, training, inference, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, the model is evaluated for the representation of the 6-DoF response predicted by LAMP of the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415 hullform (Longo and Stern, 2005) in stern-quartering Sea State 7 NATO (1983) irregular seas and self-propelled at 20 knots for both course-keeping and turning circle cases, with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller prescribing rudder motion to maintain heading during course-keeping. The developed models are evaluated for their accuracy and convergence with respect to number of wave probes and training data quantity.

Simulations or experiments are typically performed in nominal sea conditions during ship design or prior to deployment and the results may not be reflective of the instantaneous state of the vessel and the ocean environment while deployed. Short-term temporal predictions of ship responses given the current wave environment and ship state would enable enhanced decision-making onboard for both manned and unmanned vessels. However, the current state-of-the-art in numerical hydrodynamic simulation tools are too computationally expensive to be employed for real-time ship motion forecasting and the computationally efficient tools are too low fidelity to provide accurate responses. A methodology is developed with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to represent the motions of a free running David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415 destroyer operating at 20 knots in Sea State 7 stern-quartering irregular seas. Case studies are performed for both course-keeping and turning circle scenarios. An estimate of the vessel's encounter frame is made with the trajectories observed in the training dataset. Wave elevation time histories are given by artificial wave probes that travel with the estimated encounter frame and serve as input into the neural network, while the output is the 6-DOF temporal ship motion response. Overall, the neural network is able to predict the temporal response of the ship due to unseen waves accurately, which makes this methodology suitable for system identification and real-time ship motion forecasting. The methodology, the dependence of model accuracy on wave probe and training data quantity and the estimated encounter frame are all detailed."}
{"prompt": "Should the Varicam be mentioned? And maybe for an indie-filmmaking section, it could include the upcoming HVX200 (Panasonic) 1080-24p 16:9 variable frame-rate camcorder for only $6,000. Also, i n the Mini DV section, the XL2 is mentioned; although most people will make the claim that the dvx100b is superior (it's in the same price range). It is MUCH more often used in filmmaking (if you do an imdb.com technical search, the dvx comes up with dozens upon dozens of results of movies which used the camera, while the XL2 comes up with barely any.) And, the article seems to make a few naming mistakes with the CineAlta cameras. At one point, it notes that Sin city is shot with the HDC-950; but should it be HDC-f950? Earlier on in the article, the new improved CineAlta is called the HDW950 -- is this different from the HDC-950 or HDC-f950? The 'DVX100B' is not superior to the XL2 being only a native 4:3 camera (the XL2 is native 16:9) and having a fixed lens (the XL2 has interchangeable lenses). Although it may appear to be \"...MUCH more often used in filmmaking (if you do an imdb.com technical search, the dvx comes up with dozens upon dozens of results of movies which used the camera, while the XL2 comes up with barely any.)\", these are infact low budget and wanabee \"features\" - to get on IMBD does not signify true mainstream international production credentials. By this criteria you could say that the Canon XL1s and SONY PD150 are superior to the DVX100B, which would clearly tell you nothing about there choice as 'premier' making filmtools either. The Varicam is rarely used for theatrical production and the HVX200 is not even fully released.

{"prompt": "While government officials denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, many felt that he was made an example of by the government. Soon afterwards, marijuana advocates started the Free Tommy Chong! movement that called for his release. The controversy over Tommy Chongs prosecution centered on the rationale behind focusing on Tommy Chong as opposed to his son, Paris, the disparity in sentences that Tommy Chong received compared to other defendants, and the tactics that the DEA utilized in carrying out the investigation. [8] Paris, Tommys son, had started the Nice Dreams in 1999. At the time of the indictment period, Paris was the CEO of the company that was the center of the investigation. Paris was never charged with a crime in relation to the investigation. When asked why the government had focused on Tommy Chong opposed to the companys CEO, Paris, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan responded that Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product. [8] Of the 55 people targeted in the investigation, Tommy Chong was the only one without previous convictions that received jail time. [8] When questioned on the disparity between sentences/fines that the other 54 individuals received compared to Mr. Chong, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan stated, \"He (Tommy Chong) wasn't the biggest supplier. He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other.\" [10] In investigating the operations of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from Pittsburghs neighboring Beaver County and plead with Paris to sell them his pipes through the mail to a fictitious shop in Beaver Falls. Paris had set in place a company prohibition against selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in western Pennsylvania. [8] The prohibition was put in place in response to the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, whose two head shops sold drug paraphernalia in the citys downtown. [8] To date, it is unclear how the prohibition was broken and there exists differing accounts as to who broke the company policy which resulted in the action that brought about the ability of the US Attorney to argue that jurisdiction for the crime rests in Pittsburgh opposed to California, the base of operations for Nice Dreams.
