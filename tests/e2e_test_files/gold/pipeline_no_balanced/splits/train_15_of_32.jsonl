{"prompt": " Why are there so many returned Atlas 40v and 80v tools at every harbor freight I go to?", "completion": "I don\u2019t see many at my HFT. The returns are mostly generators, trash water pumps, and 20v tools. I bought the 80v Atlas blower for my wife to use at her job(equestrian barn manager) and she has used it every day for about a year. Loves it vs the Kobalt one they used to have that broke. Ended up liking it so much we just bought the 80v weed trimmer. Glad you guys like them. I have plenty of Bauer 20v tools and each works great especially for the price. Didn\u2019t pull the trigger on any atlas tools though Same on the Bauer tools. I\u2019ve got the 20v 10\u201d saw, angle grinder, and 1/2\u201d impact. All have been great. My drill and 1/4\u201d impact are Bosch but that\u2019s bc I\u2019ve had them forever.\n\nJust waiting on that 20v fan to be back in stock. Been hunting that at the 2 or 3 HFTs around me all summer. I got a Bauer fan a couple weeks ago and I got unlucky with it having a bad bearing and it makes a ton of noise. No store near me has another one in stock that I could do an exchange with. I can deal with the noise but it\u2019s a slight inconvenience I\u2019ll just have to deal with or try and fix one day "}

{"prompt": "I don't understand racism. It's strange to write that down but it's no less true, racism doesn't make any sense. Why does skin color matter? What is it about skin color that bothers people? What could possibly cause a person to believe that their skin makes them superior? It baffles me. Life is hard enough, why carry such an unnecessary and bizarre hatred on top of that? I find that in my life I need as many friends as I can make. The world makes more sense when you connect with people. To rule out connecting with someone over something like the color of their skin is just not something I can make any sense of.\n\nI'm not seeking to understand racists; I know that they are just wrong in their hatred but I can't understand the conviction that drives them. Is it some sort of misguided notion of maleness? Tribalism that has yet to be evolved out of the species? What drives people to hate someone for a reason such as skin color? Hatred of any kind is hard on the soul. I am certainly not without hate, I hate racists, I hate those who hate the LGBTQ Community, I hate those who would seek to oppress others. Carrying that hate is the biggest burden of my life but I do it because I can't not do it. My hatred makes sense because I hate on behalf of others. The hatred that comes from the racist simply makes no sense.\n\nThis is a longwinded way of getting around to reviewing the new Rob Reiner movie LBJ https://geeks.media/movie-review-lbj?_ga=2.268779825.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710 Does it seem like the reviewer who wrote this review liked the movie?", "completion": "No"}
{"prompt": "Children aged nine taken into care after assaulting their parents: Four were removed from homes by social workers last year Given the previous title, can you write a story?", "completion": "At least four under 10s were removed from their homes last year in order to protect their parents, according to newly uncovered figures. The true number is likely to be far higher, since police investigate hundreds of incidents of domestic violence carried out by children every year. In response to a Freedom of Information request, Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council revealed that last year it placed three children under the age of 10 in care because of their violence towards their parents. Slough Borough Council took one child aged nine or younger away from their parents in 2014 - while dozens of other councils refused to release statistics on the issue. In total, 48 children from across Britain were taken into care to protect their parents, according to the data available. It is not known exactly what the children did to get removed from their parents, but they would not usually be taken into care except in the most extreme circumstances. Children aged 10 or above could be liable for criminal prosecution over their violent behaviour, but anyone younger cannot be held legally responsible for their actions. Earlier this year, single mother Pauline Bubb went public about her struggle to control her violent children, who have been attacking her since they were just four. Her son Spencer once stabbed her in the stomach with a pair of scissors, while nine-year-old daughter Sapphire hits and bites her in a bid to get her way. And a Channel 5 documentary last year followed the story of Bobbi, a single mother who is frequently beaten up by her son JJ. Childhood experts say that violent children are likely to have suffered trauma themselves, and should be treated rather than punished. Camila Batmanghelidjh, head of charity Kids Company, told The Sun: 'Violence is cyclical. If children are causing harm the likelihood is they've been harmed.' A spokesman for the NSPCC added: 'Many of these children will need help because they may be from very troubled backgrounds.' Last week it emerged that the number of children in London being investigated by police for attacking their parents had risen by 60 per cent in two years. The Metropolitan Police launched probes into 1,437 under-18s who were suspected of carrying out violent crimes against their parents in 2014. Researchers say that the vast majority of victims in such cases are mothers - but they also warn that many parents are unwilling to report their own children to the police after being attacked."}
