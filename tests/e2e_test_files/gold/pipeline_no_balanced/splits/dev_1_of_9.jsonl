{"prompt": "Recently the crowd counting has received more and more attention. Especially the technology of high-density environment has become an important research content, and the relevant methods for the existence of extremely dense crowd are not optimal. In this paper, we propose a multi-level attentive Convolutional Neural Network (MLAttnCNN) for crowd counting. We extract high-level contextual information with multiple different scales applied in pooling, and use multi-level attention modules to enrich the characteristics at different layers to achieve more efficient multi-scale feature fusion, which is able to be used to generate a more accurate density map with dilated convolutions and a $1\\times 1$ convolution. The extensive experiments on three available public datasets show that our proposed network achieves outperformance to the state-of-the-art approaches.

{"prompt": "HE freight sector accounts for 60% of cargoes, and this trend continues to increase rapidly [1] . However, longdistance and high-volume logistics operations consume a large amount of fuel. In the European Union, the energy consumption of road freight transportation is 27% among all transport modes, leading to 20% carbon emission of total emissions [2] . Truck platooning is considered one of the most promising cuttingedge technologies to alleviate energy consumption and environmental pollution, and refers to a group of trucks traveling with relative short headways for a long period via telecommunication [3] , [4] . Truck platooning can effectively reduce aerodynamic resistance between leading and following vehicles, and is thus able to lower the total energy consumptions of trucks [5] . Truck platooning can also improve road safety and enhance capacity aside from offering energy savings [6] , [7] , [8] . With the abovementioned features, truck platooning is undoubtedly a hot topic. Theoretically speaking, truck platooning can be a leader-following consensus problem. In the past decades, a myriad of control theory-based approaches are proposed. Zhang et al. [9] considered a leader-follower consensus of multiagent system with communication capability and energy constraints, and modeled the system using Markovian approach and Lyapunov stability theory. Zhang et al. [10] investigated the issue of leader-following consensus in a linear and Lipschitz nonlinear multiagent system with limited information. Wen et al. [11] proposed a neural network-based leader-follower consensus scheme. Tan et al. [12] developed a distributed event-triggered impulsive control method to study the leader-following consensus issue. You et al. [13] studies the leader-following consensus problem in the environment of high-order nonlinear mulitiagent system, and used a self-trigger and dynamic output feedback control scheme. Yue and Meng [14] extended the leader-following consensus issue into a cooperative set problem, where multiple agents can be aggregated into a desired set. They proposed an approximate projection algorithm and proved its convergence conditions. Liu et al. [15] emphasized the synchronization of mobile agent platoon, where each agent's speed and heading is different. Petrillo et al. [16] further designed a control mechanism to resist cyberattacks in a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon. The above solid theoretical work sheds substantial light on cybernetic principles of truck platooning but still focuses on simulation rather than empirical validation. Bhoopalam et al. [17] divided truck platooning into three categories: scheduled platooning, real-time platooning, and opportunistic platooning. The former two tend to be applied to regional planning with prior intervention and coordination, and are also known as planned platooning, whereas the latter more likely happens in a realistic environment where trucks that are in close proximity are ad-hoc informed about platooning. For planned platooning, logistics schedules, origin/destination information (i.e., locations and times), and delay tolerance are often acquired in advance to minimize network-level fuel consumption or maximize the platoon size. However, industrial resistance and practical factors hinder the wide implementation of planned platooning. Logistics operators are reluctant to change their route delivery schedules and routes to cater to platooning with other companies [18] . Compared with passenger vehicles, trucks' estimated arrival time are more uncertain due to road congestion, overload inspection, and driving hour limitation, making network-wide truck platooning optimization impossible to solve in a finite time frame as a NPhard issue. Fortunately, high-fidelity truck GPS data from freight fleet management systems reproduce trucks' actual spatiotemporal footprints and can be utilized to coordinate trucks to form platoons by identifying leaders and followers from massive trajectories. Such adjustments do not require prior planning, and truck platoons can be spontaneously formed by slightly adjusting speeds on certain road segments rather than changing routes. As indicated by Liang et al. [19] , the energy savings induced by truck platooning can be counteracted by the energy consumptions by detouring to seek platooning opportunities. In addition, as the national road network density increases, investing in and constructing roadside units on each segment is not realistic to facilitate V2V communications. Highlighting road segments with high platooning possibilities will be beneficial to prioritize the existing roadside facilities to be upgraded for truck platooning. Therefore, this study aims to develop framework to mine massive truck trajectories to identify possible truck platoon patterns. The proposed trajectory mining procedure is to detect leaders and followers within a short distance for a given time period. The identified patterns actually reduce the computational complexity of truck platoon planning by emphasizing the speed coordination between leading and following trucks in a large-scale network. The entire framework is composed of four steps. In the first step, a modified map matching algorithm considering relative driving direction is proposed to map each truck's locations on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) network. We further recognize the instantaneous codriving sets with the same directions and close spacing by using enhanced ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) algorithm. Among the generated sets, the spontaneous truck platooning patterns are found based on frequent itemset mining in depth-first spanning trees. In the final step, a fuel consumption estimation model is adopted to quantify the energy savings of the identified truck platoons, where all parameters are calibrated from either field data or existing literature. We systematically evaluate the platooning potentials and performance by using several metrics. To summarize, the primary contributions of this study are twofold: (1) A series of trajectory mining approaches is proposed to identify spontaneous truck platooning patterns. To be specific, an enhanced OPTICS algorithm is proposed to detect instantaneous co-driving sets from millions of truck GPS points. This algorithm replaces the original Euclidean distance with the following distance between trucks and considers driving direction, roadway junction, and angle of reachability distance sequence, thus improving the detection rate of sub-centralized and speed-coordinated truck fleets. The largest truck set with the longest co-driving time-period is extracted from the instantaneous co-driving sets of the entire day by using frequent itemset mining algorithm. (2) On the basis of massive truck trajectory data in Liaoning Province, China, we answer how many trucks could be coupled as platoons and how much fuel savings could be achieved for a specific day. We also prioritize those road segments with high platooning potential, which can provide solid policy support to upgrade existing roadside facilities for automating freight transportation. The remaining part of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 reviews different truck platooning modes and emphasizes trajectory mining approaches for co-movement pattern identification. Section 3 describes the methodological framework, which involves a modified hidden Markov model (HMM)-based map matching algorithm tailored for truck platooning, an enhanced OPTICS algorithm to recognize instantaneous co-driving sets, and a pruning algorithm to find the potential instantaneous platooning patterns. We further introduce the fuel consumption estimation model. Section 4 provides the detailed data collection efforts and several platooning performance indicators. Section 5 analyzes one-day truck trajectory data collected in Liaoning Province, China, and evaluates the platooning performance and energy savings by using the proposed spontaneous platooning pattern mining approaches. The spatiotemporal distribution of truck platoons is visualized in a map. Section 6 presents the conclusions and envisions the future directions. Can you express the main content of the text?", "completion": "Truck platooning refers to a series of trucks driving in close proximity via communication technologies, and it is considered one of the most implementable systems of connected and automated vehicles, bringing huge energy savings and safety improvements. Properly planning platoons and evaluating the potential of truck platooning are crucial to trucking companies and transportation authorities. This study proposes a series of data mining approaches to learn spontaneous truck platooning patterns from massive trajectories. An enhanced map matching algorithm is developed to identify truck headings by using digital map data, followed by an adaptive spatial clustering algorithm to detect instantaneous co-moving truck sets. These sets are then aggregated to find the network-wide maximum platoon duration and size through frequent itemset mining for computational efficiency. We leverage real GPS data collected from truck fleeting systems in Liaoning Province, China, to evaluate platooning performance and successfully extract spatiotemporal platooning patterns. Results show that approximately 36% spontaneous truck platoons can be coordinated by speed adjustment without changing routes and schedules. The average platooning distance and duration ratios for these platooned trucks are 9.6% and 9.9%, respectively, leading to a 2.8% reduction in total fuel consumption. We also distinguish the optimal platooning periods and space headways for national freeways and trunk roads, and prioritize the road segments with high possibilities of truck platooning. The derived results are reproducible, providing useful policy implications and operational strategies for large-scale truck platoon planning and roadside infrastructure construction."}
