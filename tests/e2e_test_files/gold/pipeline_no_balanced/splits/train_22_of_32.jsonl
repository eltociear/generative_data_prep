{"prompt": " When do the revival events come out? Is it 2 years after the original event?", "completion": "You can actually go back and view the story in-game: just go to My Room --&gt; Material --&gt; Event Quest Log --&gt;Servant Summer Camp!- Chaldea's Thriller Night. However if you're dead-set on waiting for the re-run then we should get it around the end of May and start of June next year (though that could change as NA often juggles events around that time of year to make sure we get Anniversary at the right time in early July).\n\nAlso in the future please use the Question thread at the top of the wiki for questions like these. I knew you could look at main story logs, I didn't know event logs were saved there too, thanks for letting me know. "}
{"prompt": "Peter Sutcliffe is now completely blind after a failed attempt to undo damage to his eyesight caused by diabetes. The 71-year-old killer has to have a buddy wheel him around Frankland Prison in County Durham, where he has been moaning about being unable to watch TV. An injection to clear the blurriness in his right eye went horribly wrong, with the murderer telling a friend 'they have f***** up my eyesight'. After losing the sight in his left eye when another inmate attacked in him in 1997, the attempt to improve vision in his right eye left him without vision in either, The Sun reports. 'They bodged it and I cant see at all,' the killer said. 'I cant watch the TV or read letters and emails. I made a cuppa but missed the cup with the milk  its awful.' The serial killer will be applying for a white stick to help him get around the prison, where he is serving 20 concurrent life sentences. Sutcliffe murdered 13 women in the UK and attempted to murder seven others. The former Bradford lorry driver attacked and murdered women between 1976 and 1981 using knives, hammers and screwdrivers. Most of his victims were women working as prostitutes. But last year heconfessed on tape to a savage attack on a 14-year-old schoolgirl because he wrongly thought she was a prostitute. Sutcliffe admitted hitting Tracy Browne with a branch before throwing her over a wall. Despite having suffered two fractures to her skull Tracy managed to stagger to a farmworker's caravan and he raised the alarm. Sutcliffe confessed to being the Yorkshire Ripper in 1981 after police apprehended him with a prostitute. Given the text and its first key point 'Peter Sutcliffe was undergoing treatment to reverse damage caused by diabetes', what would be a second key point? 'But he told a friend how they 'f***** up' his eyesight and left him totally blind' or 'The killer lost sight in his left eye in 1997 when a fellow inmate attacked him'?", "completion": "But he told a friend how they 'f***** up' his eyesight and left him totally blind"}
{"prompt": " HELP - Skywalker Saga DioramasHey everyone! I'm in need of some assistance.  I am working on creating all of the dioramas in real brick form.  The only issue is I don't the best angles on some of them.  Particularly episodes IX and V.  I wanted to see if anyone was able to help and send me screenshots of as many angles as they can of these builds.

{"prompt": " Does anybody else randomly loose all skills they haveSo this is very specific but as a creative person I get sparks in creativity where I will draw and paint and create masterpieces.\nMaybe not masterpieces but things that I am proud of, however, lately I feel like I have lost my ability to paint and draw etc.\nI also sing and sometimes I\u2019m good at singing and sometimes I\u2019m really bad.\nI never seem to be consistently good at anything.\nDoes anybody else loose there ability to do things they are usually good at?", "completion": "Digital artist here, been drawing for around 16 years now. Straight up, if you rely on the \"muse\" to determine when you can draw then you will hardly ever be able to draw. What's needed is a daily drawing habit as well as learning and training fundamentals of anatomy and perspective. Once you've done this for long enough, you'll be able to power through low points and still get the work done. The good news is, once you're able to do this consistently then the days where the muse hits and you're really on fire will be even more magnificent.   \n\n\nI'm not a singer, but I imagine the same thing applies in terms of training every day. It takes determination and grit, but the payoff is worth it long term. Good luck! Thank you for your advice, I\u2019ll try and make a routine :) "}

If they don\u2019t pre-emptively do it tonight, those customers (plus a significantly larger number of customers including hospitals) would be out of power for a much more significant amount of time tomorrow when it\u2019s actually hot out because the system failed catastrophically. Did you not read the article? I mean this work could have been done in April or May when it wasn't that hot. I don\u2019t disagree, but sometimes it\u2019s not clear which sections are vulnerable until the system is stressed. "}
