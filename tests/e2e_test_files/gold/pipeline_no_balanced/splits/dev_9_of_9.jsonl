{"prompt": "Divisibility monoids are a natural lattice-theoretical generalization of Mazurkiewicz trace monoids, namely monoids in which the distributivity of the involved divisibility lattices is kept as an hypothesis, but the relations between the generators are not supposed to necessarily be commutations. Here, we show that every divisibility monoid admits an explicit finite transducer which allows to compute normal forms in quadratic time. In addition, we prove that every divisibility monoid is biautomatic. What can be an appropriate title for the previous text?", "completion": "Finite transducers for divisibility monoids"}
{"prompt": " Dirty fuses causing bad ground?I just changed my alternator on my 02 3.0 V6 and I still get a high pitched whine from my speakers. I cleaned the chassis ground and the ground on the radiator support, and I've got an amplifier for subwoofers that I'd assume adds to the main ground loop (seeing as my headlights worked better after installing and it cleared my check engine light)\n\nThe last thing I can think of is the ground for the main harness, but when I bought the car it refused to start. I removed the fuse and wiped the tines and it solved the issue. Haven't had a no start since then, but that makes me wonder if maybe the fuses being dirty could be causing this? It is a cheap \"DUAL\" brand stereo, but I've never had a whine with this model in any other car. If definitely picking up the ignition as it increases with RPM. Any advice is welcome!", "completion": "Dirty fuses don't cause audio whine, nor do they provide a ground (unless a stereo installer got very creative.) Stereo is installed properly. I did it myself and installation is something I've been working on turning into my career. So it's either an issue in the wiring or an issue with the actual grounding point for the stereo harness "}

{"prompt": "A schoolgirl was banned from the classroom on her first day of the new school year after her black trousers were deemed too tight. Ellisha Oliver returned to her school in South Shields last week in what she thought were smart, new black trousers. But the 14-year-old was left in shock when teachers at South Shields Community School imposed new rules, which mean trousers must be at least 14cm wide at the bottom. Ellisha and several other girls were then handed new pairs of trousers from Asda and ordered to change into them or face being sent home. She claims that the pair she was given were too big and was taken home by her mother Stacy. The 36-year-old from South Shields said: 'I've never known anything like it. 'I sent her to school wearing a perfectly fine pair of trousers, but she has been told to take them off and wear these ones, which are trailing the ground because they're so big and she's tiny. 'She ended up missing a day of school because of this. 'As for the young girls who have just started, they were beside themselves. 'What a horrible first day for them, being forced to get changed. 'It's embarrassing. Do they want the kids to look silly?' However, the school has defended its uniform policy, with new headteacher Allie Denholm saying she was tightening up standards. She explained: 'We gave the children a choice to either go and change their clothes in a private place or we would contact their parents to come and collect them. 'All students were treated with respect and dignity. 'There have been no changes to the uniform policy. We are just tightening it up.' In the article, which of the following is mentioned first? 'But South Shields Community School say they're tightening up on standards' or 'Her mother Stacy was called after she was sent home by school staff'?", "completion": "Her mother Stacy was called after she was sent home by school staff"}
