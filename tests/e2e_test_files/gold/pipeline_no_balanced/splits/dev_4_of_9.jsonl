{"prompt": "Mr. Monopoly | Monopoly Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia Share Mr. Monopoly with his Monopoly game board Mr. Monopoly, originally known as Rich Uncle Pennybags, is the long-standing mascot of Parker Brothers ' (later Hasbro 's) classic Monopoly game. History Arguably the most recognizable board game icon in the world, Mr. Monopoly has been a guest in almost every family's house (through the game Monopoly) at one point or another, but did you know that the elderly mustached millionaire is not exclusive to Monopoly? In fact, Mr. Monopoly isn't even his real name. Created by down-and-out inventor Charles Darrow during the Depression-era '30s, Mr. Monopoly (or Rich Uncle Pennybags, if you'd prefer his given name) and the game he adores was initially rejected by Parker Bros. So we guess you could call Rich Uncle Pennybags a self-made millionaire, as Darrow sold locally printed facsimiles of his board game on the street, making Rich Uncle Pennybags an illustrated icon for the people. When Parker Brothers finally got on board in 1935, Rich Uncle Pennybags was already well known enough to front other of the company's board games. In 1940, he became the star of a game called Dig. In 1946, he fronted the eponymous Rich Uncle. According to The Monopoly Companion, he was not added to Monopoly boards until 1936. In the Game Mr. Monopoly is seen on the actual game board as well as on the Chance and Community Chest Cards. What board game's original mascot was Rich Uncle Pennybags?", "completion": "Monopoly"}

{"prompt": "We use deep, spatially resolved spectroscopy from the LEGA-C Survey to study radial variations in the stellar population of 17 spectroscopically-selected post-starburst (PSB) galaxies. We use spectral fitting to measure two Lick indices, $H{\\delta}_A$ and $Fe4383$, and find that, on average, PSB galaxies have radially decreasing $H{\\delta}_A$ and increasing $Fe4383$ profiles. In contrast, a control sample of quiescent, non-PSB galaxies in the same mass range shows outwardly increasing $H{\\delta}_A$ and decreasing $Fe4383$. The observed gradients are weak ($\\approx-0.2$ \\r{A}/$R_e$), mainly due to seeing convolution. A two-SSP model suggests intrinsic gradients are as strong as observed in local PSB galaxies ($\\approx -0.8$ \\r{A}$/R_e$). We interpret these results in terms of inside-out growth (for the bulk of the quiescent population) vs star formation occurring last in the centre (for PSB galaxies). At $z\\approx0.8$, central starbursts are often the result of gas-rich mergers, as evidenced by the high fraction of PSB galaxies with disturbed morphologies and tidal features (40%). Our results provide additional evidence for multiple paths to quiescence: a standard path, associated with inside-out disc formation and with gradually decreasing star-formation activity, without fundamental structural transformation, and a fast path, associated with centrally-concentrated starbursts, leaving an inverse age gradient and smaller half-light radius.
