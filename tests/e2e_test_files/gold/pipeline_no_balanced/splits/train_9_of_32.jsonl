{"prompt": "The Supreme Court is taking on a new clash between gay rights and religion in a case about a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado. The justices said Monday they will consider whether a baker who objects to same-sex marriage on religious grounds can refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The case asks the high court to balance the religious rights of the baker against the couple's right to equal treatment under the law. Similar disputes have popped up across the United States. The decision to take on the case reflects renewed energy among the court's conservative justices, whose ranks have recently been bolstered by the addition of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the high court. The court will review a Colorado court decision that found baker Jack Phillips and his Masterpiece Cakeshop discriminated against the gay couple under Colorado law. Phillips told the Supreme Court he has free speech and religious rights under the First Amendment that should protect him. He said he should not be compelled to bake a cake specifically to honor a same-sex marriage. Colorado's anti-discrimination law protects people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Charlie Craig and David Mullins filed a complaint against Phillips and his suburban Denver shop after Phillips said he would not create and decorate a cake in honor of their marriage. Colorado did not permit same-sex couples to marry until 2014. Two years earlier, Craig and Mullin were planning to fly to Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legal, and host a reception in Denver upon their return to Colorado. They wanted a cake for the occasion. The couple is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Colorado. 'This has always been about more than a cake. Businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love,' said Mullins in a statement released by the ACLU. Craig added, 'While we're disappointed that the courts continue debating the simple question of whether LGBT people deserve to be treated like everyone else, we hope that our case helps ensure that no one has to experience being turned away simply because of who they are.' In the article, what is mentioned right after 'The case originated when a Colorado-based baker refused to make a cake for a gay couple celebrating their wedding'? 'The baker had refused to make wedding cakes for same-sex couples because he said it was against his Christian religion' or 'The Supreme Court has decided to take up a case that pits religious liberty against gay rights'?", "completion": "The baker had refused to make wedding cakes for same-sex couples because he said it was against his Christian religion"}

They just weren't selected for bilaterial series cause of board disputes after 2014 player strike in India tour. hence it's not really a surprise they're not on the list right? Yeah just not for the reason you stated. Which part? Windies not playing as much is true, and Rohit playing more for India than those guys for Windies is true. I'm confused? "}

{"prompt": "Automated translation of Polish-English speech, as compared to the other languages, is a formidable challenge. It is complicated declension, leading to a very wide range of vocabulary, its grammatical components and rules, cases, gender forms (7 and 15, respectively) for nouns and adjectives that drive its complexity. This complexity impacts both the Polish language data and data structures necessary for the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Polish and English are very different in their syntax. Since English lacks declension endings, the way in which words are ordered in an English sentence is very significant for their meaning. English sentences follow a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. The syntactic order often completely determines the meaning of a sentence. On the other hand, syntactic order in Polish does not significantly influence the meaning of a sentence. It does not require any specific word order. For example, the English sentence \"I went to cinema with my wife.\" is equivalent in Polish to many sentences like \"Byem w kinie z moj on.\", \"Z moj on byem w kinie.\", \"W kinie byem z moj on.\", \"Z moj on w kinie byem.\", \"Byem z moj on w kinie.\", \"W kinie z moj on byem.\". Translation is greatly complicated by these differences in syntactic order between the two languages. This is particularly arduous when no additional lexical data is available and a phrase model [1] is used, which is often the case in the SMT systems. The optimal input data for the SMT systems should have restricted subject domains like medical texts, historical books, European Parliament proceeding etc. It is very difficult for the SMT system to perform well using diverse domains. There are few Polish language corpora available to be used as input to the SMT systems. As a result, good sets of parallel Polish-English data have limited availability. The baseline datasets used for this research were: Trans-language English Database (TED) [2] , the Open Parallel Corpus 1 (OPUS) of movie subtitles, and the European Parliament (Europarl) 2 proceedings texts. The choice was not random. The TED represents lectures with no specific domain, OpenSubtitles are also not limited to any domain but they are a great example of casual human dialogs, that consist of many short sentences (easier to be translated by the SMT system), Europarl is an example of good quality in-domain data. In around 137 words, briefly describe what the previous paragraph talks about.", "completion": "This research investigates the Statistical Machine Translation approaches to translate speech in real time automatically. Such systems can be used in a pipeline with speech recognition and synthesis software in order to produce a real-time voice communication system between foreigners. We obtained three main data sets from spoken proceedings that represent three different types of human speech. TED, Europarl, and OPUS parallel text corpora were used as the basis for training of language models, for developmental tuning and testing of the translation system. We also conducted experiments involving part of speech tagging, compound splitting, linear language model interpolation, TrueCasing and morphosyntactic analysis. We evaluated the effects of variety of data preparations on the translation results using the BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER metrics and tried to give answer which metric is most suitable for PL-EN language pair."}
