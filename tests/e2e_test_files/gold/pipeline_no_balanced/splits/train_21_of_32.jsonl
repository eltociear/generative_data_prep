{"prompt": " Invading: Stay Sharp abilityBeen playing as an invader and loving it. With a bit over 200 kills I gotta say I don't see what this \"*Stay Sharp*\" ability is supposed to be doing?  \n\n\nI've been mainly using it as an AOE Tagging ability, which is great to tag AI through walls but I don't see them really reacting differently. Yeah they respond verbally but am I missing something or is this all the ability does?", "completion": "Might be placebo, but whenever I use it when the tagged soldiers are red/aggro, they almost instantly triangulate where Karl is (the red triangle appears where Karl was last seen). When they are yellow and I use it they actually start searching for Karl instead of crouching behind cover. Again, might just be coincidence. I really wish they would be more clear on what it does, I really want to know if what I've experienced is either coincidence or accurate Cool! I appreciate you sharing your experience. I hope that is what it does. Next time I use it I'll try and look out for what you mentioned. I have had a similar experience especially when it comes to allies going from yellow to red.  But rn my current invasion strategy is to tag everyone on the map and it's super helpful for tagging people through walls and in buildings. "}
{"prompt": "A breathtaking new marble-like image of our sun has been captured by NASA. The colourful picture was taken using data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR. The data was combined with images from other telescopes to create the most stunning image of the sun yet. Scroll down for video NuSTAR usually spends its time investigating the mysteries of black holes, supernovae, and other high-energy objects in space, but it can also look closer to home to study our sun. The high-energy X-rays seen by NuSTAR are shown in blue, while green represents lower-energy X-rays from the X-ray Telescope instrument on the Hinode spacecraft, named after the Japanese word for sunrise. The yellow and red colors show ultraviolet light from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. All three telescopes captured their solar images at around the same time on April 29 to create a mosaic. 'We can see a few active regions on the sun in this view,' said Iain Hannah of the University of Glasgow, Scotland, who presented the image today, July 8, at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno, Wales. 'Our sun is quieting down in its activity cycle, but still has a couple of years before it reaches a minimum.' Those active areas of the sun are filled with flares, which are giant eruptions on the surface of the sun that spew out charged particles and high-energy radiation. They occur when magnetic field lines become tangled and broken, and then reconnect. Due to its extreme sensitivity, NuSTAR's telescope cannot view the larger flares. But it can help measure the energy of smaller microflares, which produce only one-millionth the energy of the larger flares. NuSTAR may also be able to directly detect hypothesized nanoflares, which would be only one-billionth the energy of flares. Nanoflares -- which may help explain why the sun's atmosphere, or corona, is much hotter than expected -- would be hard to spot due to their small size. However, nanoflares may emit high-energy X-rays that NuSTAR has the sensitivity to detect. Astronomers suspect that these tiny flares, like their larger brethren, can send electrons flying at tremendous velocities. As the electrons zip around, they give off high-energy X-rays. 'We still need the sun to quiet down more over the next few years to have the ability to detect these events,' said Hannah, explaining that, while our sun is approaching the tranquil end of its roughly 11-year activity cycle, it has been showing spurious bouts of high activity. In around 36 words, summarize the core of the above text.", "completion": "Colourful new image of our sun uses data from NASA's NuSTAR telescope.

{"prompt": "Predicting the future trajectory of surrounding vehicles is essential for the navigation of autonomous vehicles in complex real-world driving scenarios. It is challenging as a vehicle's motion is affected by many factors, including its surrounding infrastructures and vehicles. In this work, we develop the ReCoG (Recurrent Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks), which is a general scheme that represents vehicle interactions with infrastructure information as a heterogeneous graph and applies graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the high-level interactions for trajectory prediction. Nodes in the graph contain corresponding features, where a vehicle node contains its sequential feature encoded using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and an infrastructure node contains spatial feature encoded using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then the ReCoG predicts the future trajectory of the target vehicle by jointly considering all of the features. Experiments are conducted by using the INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed ReCoG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of different types of displacement error, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.

{"prompt": " Roles of men and women in colonial massachusetts?", "completion": "Women were usually in charge of spinning the (making colthes) becuase there wasnt much clothes in the early colonial times. They were incharge of cooking the meals (breakfast dinner) Women often helped take care of the chickens by collecting eggs and milking the cows. They made soap during the winter and also made candles. Women brewed beer (becuase not much pepople drank water) They were expected to have alot of good knowledge in medicine and firstaid. But ofcourse not all women were very good in these tasks. Thats why they recieved help from their daughters and taught them how to work the house at a young age. Men usually did the big jobs like farming while the woman would help and assist. For examlpe if the man was to chop off the pigs the women would help by turning those pigs and making them into suasages,."}
