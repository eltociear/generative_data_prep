In 1841, he was admitted to the bar at Pontiac and then moved to the village of Lapeer, Michigan to began to a practice. He was appointed prosecuting attorney for Lapeer County in 1843 by Governor William Woodbridge. He moved back to Pontiac to join a law firm there. Wisner was not especially active in politics until after the election of U.S. President Franklin Pierce in 1852, when he became active in the anti-slavery movement. He was one of the foremost critics in Michigan of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened the territories to slavery. He participated in the first convention of the U.S. Republican Party in Jackson, Michigan in July, 1854 where he declined nomination as Michigan Attorney General. That same year he was an unsuccessful candidate from Michigan's 4th congressional district to the U.S. House against Democrat George Washington Peck. In 1858, Wisner was elected Governor of Michigan by a large majority and served one term from 1859 to 1861. After his term was over he returned to his home in Pontiac and resumed the practice of law.

{"prompt": "Electricity generation from renewable resources combined with wide-ranging electrification has been a mainstay of European climate and energy policies, with the primary goal of decarbonising the power sector as well as other carbon-intensive sectors. Major obstacles to such endeavours have nevertheless surfaced in recent years. Firstly, sectors like aviation, shipping, heating or industry have proved difficult to fully electrify. Indeed, feedstocks and energy carriers with specific properties such as a high energy density are typically required (Eveloy et al., 2021) . Hence, the production of carbon-neutral synthetic fuels and feedstocks from renewable electricity has been the focus of a growing body of literature. For example, the synthesis of carbon-neutral hydrogen (Borgschulte, 2016) , methane (Biswas et al., 2020) , methanol (Centi et al., 2020) and ammonia (Ghavam et al., 2021) have all been considered. A number of demonstration projects have been carried out as well (Wulf et al., 2020) . Secondly, it has become clear that the technical renewable potential of some European countries (i.e., the maximum amount of renewable electricity that may produced within a country's borders and exclusive economic zone, while accounting for a variety of land eligibility constraints (Ryberg et al., 2018) ) is insufficient to supply current energy demand levels (e.g., in densely-populated countries like Belgium (Berger et al., 2020; Limpens et al., 2020) or the United Kingdom (MacKay, 2008) ). It is still unclear whether pooling renewable resources at the European level would alleviate the problem. On the other hand, it is well-documented that social acceptance issues tend to compound it (Segreto et al., 2020) . A simple solution consists in harvesting renewable resources in remote areas where they are abundant, synthesising carbon-neutral fuels or feedstocks using renewable electricity and transporting them back to demand centres (Fasihi et al., 2015; Chapman et al., 2017; Heuser et al., 2019) . However, two conditions must be satisfied for such an approach to be worth pursuing. Firstly, transport should be energy-efficient and cost-effective. This will often depend on the physics of the commodity considered and the maturity of technologies available to handle it. Secondly, very-high-quality renewable resources should be tapped. The quality of such resources is typically estimated via the annual capacity factor of a given technology harnessing them, which directly reflects the amount of electricity that may be produced per unit capacity. Since renewable power generation technologies usually have very low operating costs, the higher the capacity factor, the lower the electricity cost. Regions with outstanding resources and vast technical potential include Patagonia (wind) (Heuser et al., 2019) , North Africa (sun and wind) (Fasihi et al., 2015) and Greenland (wind) (Radu et al., 2019) . Providing an accurate quantitative assessment of the economics and efficiency of such remote renewable energy supply chains and pathways is critical to evaluate future sustainable energy supply options available to policy makers and society at large as well as to identify where to direct future research and innovation efforts. From a conceptual standpoint, a supply chain can be viewed as a networked system composed of dynamical subsystems interacting with each other. In order to tackle the problem formulated above, the collection of processes and technologies forming a remote renewable energy supply chain must be analysed in an integrated fashion, which makes it possible to properly capture the interactions between subsystems in space and time. In addition, a sufficient level of technical detail and temporal resolution should be used to properly model their operation (Poncelet et al., 2016) . This paper formalises these considerations and proposes a graph-based optimisation modelling framework directly applicable to the strategic planning and analysis of remote renewable energy supply chains. More precisely, a graph abstraction of planning problems is introduced, wherein nodes can be viewed as optimisation subproblems with their own parameters, variables, constraints and local objective, and typically represent a subsystem such as a technology, a plant or a process. Edges, on the other hand, express the connectivity between subsystems. The framework is then leveraged to study the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic methane production from renewable electricity and atmospheric carbon dioxide in North Africa and its delivery to Northwestern European markets. Synthetic methane is an appealing carbon-neutral energy carrier, as some downstream transport infrastructure is readily available in Northwestern European countries, and the liquefied methane chain is mature and cost-effective (Timera Energy, 2018) . It would also obviate the need for replacing or upgrading appliances and processes presently used for residential heating and in industry that a switch to other fuels would entail. In this paper, the carbon-neutral synthetic methane supply chain is modelled end-to-end, from power generation in North Africa to methane regasification in Northwestern Europe. A detailed description of each process and technology is provided, along with comprehensive data resources. The modelling framework also served as a basis for the development of an open source optimisation modelling language (Berger et al., 2021) and tool (Miftari et al., 2021) . In the interest of transparency, the input files and full data enabling others to reproduce the analyses presented in this paper are also available in the associated repository (Miftari et al., 2021) . This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 details the proposed modelling framework, while Sections 4 and 5 describe the case study and discuss results, respectively. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work directions. What is the previous article about? Please summarize in about 257 words.", "completion": "This paper studies the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic fuel production from renewable electricity in remote areas where high-quality renewable resources are abundant. To this end, a graph-based optimisation modelling framework directly applicable to the strategic planning of remote renewable energy supply chains is proposed. More precisely, a hypergraph abstraction of planning problems is introduced, wherein nodes can be viewed as optimisation subproblems with their own parameters, variables, constraints and local objective. Nodes typically represent a subsystem such as a technology, a plant or a process. Hyperedges, on the other hand, express the connectivity between subsystems. The framework is leveraged to study the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic methane production from solar and wind energy in North Africa and its delivery to Northwestern European markets. The full supply chain is modelled in an integrated fashion, which makes it possible to accurately capture the interaction between various technologies on an hourly time scale. Results suggest that the cost of synthetic methane production and delivery would be slightly under 150 EUR/MWh (higher heating value) by 2030 for a system supplying 10 TWh annually and relying on a combination of solar photovoltaic and wind power plants, assuming a uniform weighted average cost of capital of 7%. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to assess the impact of various techno-economic parameters and assumptions on synthetic methane cost, including the availability of wind power plants, the investment costs of electrolysis, methanation and direct air capture plants, their operational flexibility, the energy consumption of direct air capture plants, and financing costs."}

{"prompt": "This is the moment a wildebeest is dragged away from its herd by a ferocious African wild dog before it fell prey to the rest of the pack. Despite its victim being more than twice its size, the dog was able to launch an attack on the wildebeest, sinking its teeth into its muzzle. The carnivore then managed to haul its struggling prey back to the rest of its pack at the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa. Scroll down for video Francois Van Heerden, a guide at the reserve - located around 165 miles from South African capital Pretoria - captured the dramatic moment on camera. He said that the wildebeest had fought hard, but in the end did not have the stamina to overcome the strength of the pack of wild dogs. Often confused with hyenas, the dogs are highly endangered and were introduced to the park in 1994 as part of a conservation effort to protect the species - often known as the 'painted dog' due to the markings on the animals coats. The original pack were faced with a host of dangers such as rabies outbreaks, territorial clashes and the odd run in with the park's lions but are now thriving. Three hunting packs currently roam the 289 square mile reserve, which is located close to the border with Botswana. The dogs live and hunt in packs, and can pursue their prey at speed of up to 40miles an hour for anything between ten minutes to an hour. Nearly 80 per cent of wild dog hunts end with a kill, compared with lions which manage to kill around 30 per cent of their prey. Wild dogs often kill their larger prey, such as wildebeest, impalas, gazelle and springbok, by firstly immobilising the victim and then disemboweling them. After a successful hunt, the dogs will regurgitate meat for the members of the pack that remained at the den during the hunt, such as the dominant female, older animals and pups.
