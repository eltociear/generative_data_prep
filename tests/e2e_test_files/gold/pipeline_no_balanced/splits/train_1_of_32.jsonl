{"prompt": "How to deal successfully with a child showing outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift. Many parents may even fail to recognize and respond to their children's need until discouragement explodes into uncooperative behavior. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school. Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain aim to provide all environment where gifted children can develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. Children here spend about half of a day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practicing in private rooms .The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths and basic sciences. What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is that the fees are high .However, each school will often scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at an early age .Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a tense and disciplined environment. They stress,however, that their main aim is to turn out \"well-rounded and well--balanced individual.\" What makes specialist music schools different from other schools? 'Their working day is longer', 'A range of musical training is offered', 'More than half the day is spent on music' or 'The children have mostly one-to-one lessons'?", "completion": "A range of musical training is offered"}

{"prompt": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attracted an enormous amount of recent attention in machine learning. In a generative adversarial network, the goal is to produce an approximation to a target data distribution  from which only samples are available. This is done iteratively via two components -a generator and a discriminator, which are usually implemented by neural networks. The generator takes in random (usually Gaussian or uniform) noise as input and attempts to transform it to match the target distribution ; the discriminator aims to accurately discriminate between samples from the target distribution and those produced by the generator. Estimation proceeds by iteratively refining the generator and the discriminator to optimize an objective function until the target distribution is indistinguishable from the distribution induced by the generator. The practical success of GANs has led to a large volume of recent literature on variants which have many desirable properties; examples are the f-GAN [10] , the MMD-GAN [5, 9] , the Wasserstein-GAN [2] , among many others. In spite of their enormous practical success, unlike more traditional methods such as maximum likelihood inference, GANs are theoretically rather poorly-understood. In particular, two very basic questions on how well they can approximate the target distribution , even in the presence of a very large number of samples and perfect optimization, remain largely unanswered. The first relates to the role of the discriminator in the quality of the approximation. In practice, the discriminator is usually restricted to belong to some family, and it is not understood in what sense this restriction affects the distribution output by the generator. The second question relates to convergence; different variants of GANs have been proposed that involve different objective functions (to be optimized by the generator and the discriminator). However, it is not understood under what conditions minimizing the objective function leads to a good approximation of the target distribution. More precisely, does a sequence of distributions output by the generator that converges to the global minimum under the objective function always converge to the target distribution  under some standard notion of distributional convergence? In this work, we consider these two questions in a broad setting. We first characterize a very general class of objective functions that we call adversarial divergences, and we show that they capture the objective functions used by a variety of existing procedures that include the original GAN [7] , f-GAN [10] , MMD-GAN [5, 9] , WGAN [2] , improved WGAN [8] , as well as a class of entropic regularized optimal transport problems [6] . We then define the class of strict adversarial divergences -a subclass of adversarial divergences where the minimizer of the objective function is uniquely the target distribution. This characterization allows us to address the two questions above in a unified setting, and translate the results to an entire class of GANs with little effort. First, we address the role of the discriminator in the approximation in Section 4. We show that if the objective function is an adversarial divergence that obeys certain conditions, then using a restricted class of discriminators has the effect of matching generalized moments. A concrete consequence of this result is that in linear f-GANs, where the discriminator family is the set of all affine functions over a vector  of features maps, and the objective function is an f-GAN, the optimal distribution  output by the GAN will satisfy E x [(x)] = E x [(x)] regardless of the specific f -divergence chosen in the objective function. Furthermore, we show that a neural network GAN is just a supremum of linear GANs, therefore has the same moment-matching effect. We next address convergence in Section 5. We show that convergence in an adversarial divergence implies some standard notion of topological convergence. Particularly, we show that provided an objective function is a strict adversarial divergence, convergence to  in the objective function implies weak convergence of the output distribution to . While convergence properties of some isolated objective functions were known before [2] , this result extends them to a broad class of GANs. An additional consequence of this result is the observation that as the Wasserstein distance metrizes weak convergence of probability distributions (see e.g. [14] ), Wasserstein-GANs have the weakest 1 objective functions in the class of strict adversarial divergences. Can you summarize the previous text?", "completion": "Generative adversarial networks (GAN) approximate a target data distribution by jointly optimizing an objective function through a \"two-player game\" between a generator and a discriminator. Despite their empirical success, however, two very basic questions on how well they can approximate the target distribution remain unanswered. First, it is not known how restricting the discriminator family affects the approximation quality. Second, while a number of different objective functions have been proposed, we do not understand when convergence to the global minima of the objective function leads to convergence to the target distribution under various notions of distributional convergence. In this paper, we address these questions in a broad and unified setting by defining a notion of adversarial divergences that includes a number of recently proposed objective functions. We show that if the objective function is an adversarial divergence with some additional conditions, then using a restricted discriminator family has a moment-matching effect. Additionally, we show that for objective functions that are strict adversarial divergences, convergence in the objective function implies weak convergence, thus generalizing previous results."}

{"prompt": "TEXT:A British family has been accused of 'conning' the Swedish state out of more than 50million kronor - 4.25million - by selling 'overpriced or mislabelled' cleaning products to local councils. Peter Gold, a wealthy British businessman now reportedly living in the U.S., set up no less than five companies selling everything from wet-wipes and bin-bags to printer ink and 'ice-melting chemicals', in Sweden in 2003. Gold's wife Janice and two sons, Daniel and Nicholas - who is married to the model daughter of celebrity chef Aldo Zilli - are all listed as former directors for several of them. Nicholas, known as Nick, wed reality TV star Laura in a lavish beachside ceremony in his parents' new hometown Miami, Florida, earlier this year, and Mrs Zilli Gold's Instagram is littered with luxurious family holiday snaps. Renowned investigative TV-show Uppdrag Granskning has now alkeged that until they went into liquidation last year, the Golds' companies had been paid 55million kronor (4.68m) in Swedish taxpayers' monies - for goodsthe investigation claims were worth just five million (430,000) They allege that the companies were able to get local councils to sign orders for their goods by using 'pushy and misleading telesales in combinations with bribes, gifts and threats'. One council in Kil, Vrmland, ended up with enough 'ice-melting chemicals' to last them 30 years, after a former council-worker signed up for deliveries from the company at a rate of 165 kronor (14) per kilo. In total, the council reportedly bought 6,440kgs (14,197lbs) of 'ice-melting chemicals' from Universal Solutions, a Stockholm-based company where all four members of the Gold family are listed as former directors. Analysis by SVT found that the chemicals was in fact 96 per cent normal road salt, retailing for around one krona per kg - around 8.5p. 'If this [the 'ice-melting chemicals'] costs 165 kronor per kilo it is definitely a con,' head of research atSwedish National Road and Transport Research InstituteBjrn Kalman toldUppdrag Granskning. Having tested the ice melting capacity of thechemicals sold by the Golds' companies against normal road salt, he added: ' I would say the effect is the same. If anything, normal salt is more effective.' All five of the Golds' companies - Royal Chemical Industries, Millennium Computer Systems, Genlite Search, Universal Solution and Interpoly Chemicals - were placed on a list of 'untrustworthy corporations' in Sweden, aimed at warning others from using their services, in 2011.
