{"prompt": "Jack Ryan: My Review\n\nI have to admit that prior to seeing the film I was not that excited. The trailer looked generic. It had Keira Knightley in a role that looked all too familiar and not in a good nostalgic sense. I went in cautiously optimistic expecting the movie to be downright terrible.\n\nI am happy to say that this movie was a home run. It is nice to see in that a sea of films like James Bond and the Bourne series that there is still room for a smart action thriller. Even more surprising is that the film is PG-13 and shows that you don't need and R rating to make a good film. In fact, none of the films in the series I mentioned have an R rating and all are successful. I dare to say that this is the best film in the entire series. \n\nWhat really stood out in Jack Ryan: SR was how personal the movie felt. The movie takes place today and they are doing with Jack Ryan the same thing they do with james Bond. Shadow Recruit would be the 5th film in the series. Here, Jack Ryan is at the beginning of his career. We were thrown into Ryan's world in this film right along with him. All while he was not sure how to handle himself. Something, I imagine, that would REALLY happen in these circumstances.\n\nThe story was smart but not spectacular. It did have some good revelations and definitely keeps you engaged the entire time. Not once did I worry about what time it was. I never had any inclination to pull out my phone to see what time it was. There is plenty to love with how the movie unfolds. I refuse to give up any plot points in my review. It is best to go on that journey with Ryan. His story is what makes this film spectacular\n\nThe cast was adequate but not spectacular. The casting that I thought was going to ruin the film actually added the most to Shadow Recruit. Keira Knightley was extremely well placed in her role. You believed her. You believed Chris Pine as Jack Ryan. They made this film work in a very personal sense. How their relationship is portrayed in the film was very organic and usually is the WORST part a film like this. Costner did a good job in his role as the recruiter. I don't normally like Costner. The only 2 films I really liked him in were Field of Dreams and Open Range. That was about it. He was great in The Man of Steel too but needed more screen time. The villain in the film was nothing new but still managed to feel fresh. \n\nI highly recommend this film. I really think the studio did a terrible job in promoting this film. I think it will die  away quickly so I hope word of mouth gets around at just how good the film is. Go and enjoy this film without having to worry about wasting your money.

{"prompt": "We study the zero temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional hard-core bosons on a square lattice with nearest neighbour and plaquette (ring-exchange) hoppings, at arbitrary densities, by means of a hierarchical mean-field theory. In the frustrated regime, where quantum Monte Carlo suffers from a sign problem, we find a rich phase diagram where exotic states with nonzero chirality emerge. Among them, novel insulating phases, characterized by nonzero bond-chirality and plaquette order, are found over a large region of the parameter space. In the unfrustrated regime, the hierarchical mean-field approach improves over the standard mean-field treatment as it is able to capture the transition from a superfluid to a valence bond state upon increasing the strength of the ring-exchange term, in qualitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo results.

{"prompt": " How 2 beat spy island on poptropica?", "completion": "This is the full solution, including spoilers. If you want to play the game, there are hints online at the Poptropica site. (see related link) You will need to rescue three captured spies from the clutches of the evil group B.A.D. -- you must save them in the proper order because each provides the items necessary to tackle the next rescue, or the game's completion. Here is the guide to each step of the solution, as the game does not provide any shortcuts. If you go left, to the dock, you will be beaten up by the B.A.D guards there. Go to the Headquarters building, top floor, and talk to Director D of the spy agency. He will tell you of the three missing spies and give you your Message Decoder. You will encounter several friendly agents who will share information. The first directs you to the Bistro, where you will need to get the fingerprint of a B.A.D. bigwig. To do this, you will get a job as a chef and steal the bad guy's wine glass. To escape with it, climb through the exhaust fan in the kitchen and jump along the ceiling light fixtures. At the Eye Doctor, you will not be trusted by the doctor. However, once you have spoken to another agent, he will tell you how to take the eye test (choose the opposite, left to right or up instead of down symbols) to show you are a trusted agent. Go upstairs and the doctor will let you in the secret spy laboratory. Get the special Chameleon Suit that he's developed. When you are standing still, you will be completely invisible to your enemies. Go back to the dock, and climb up the roof, using the chameleon suit to evade the guards (and dogs!). Enter the vent and make your way downstairs until you reach the locked vault. Go though the ceiling to rescue the agent inside. He will knock out the guards and open the bottom door for you. He will also give you the Laser Pen, and a clue to B.A.D.'s evil plan. Go back to the right, and you will get information from another agent, who gives you the Secret File. Graffiti on the next building will tell you how to read the message in it. (Somebody can't be trusted. It reads \"Don't trust Director D\") Climb the building with the electric shock fields (this takes careful timing) until you reach the attic. Cut through the bars with your laser pen. The second spy is inside and will give you his Grappling Bowtie, with which to reach tall locations. He will also give you the second of three clue cards. Go up to the rooftops on Balding Avenue, and grapple left to the tall building, then left again to avoid the guard. You will encounter another spy on the roof, who will tell you to go RIGHT to the other tall antenna. This leads to a greenhouse, where the third spy is held in a locked cage, which your Laser Pen won't cut. To open the cage, go down past the carnivorous plants (they bite) and find the Cherry Bomb tree. You can release a Cherry Bomb from the tree, and it will explode about 40 seconds later. Push it left onto the Trampoline Plant, and it will be thrown up higher. Climb up, avoid the plants, and push it left again onto the second Trampoline Plant. This will bounce it up to the cage but you have to climb up to re-position it before it explodes. The released spy will give you her UltraVision goggles, so that you can see the laser beams around the B.A.D. hiding place. You also get the final clue about the spies' evil plan. (To the left of the rooftop is the top of the brown building, where at one time there was a special Nabooti mask hanging, which has nothing to do with this island's story. You cannot climb this building from the Balding Aveneue street level.) Go to the far right, put on the goggles, and make your way through the lasers. Climb up the right side of the building and then move up and left until you can enter the hideout. (The lasers will knock you down a lot, but not harm you.) Use the \"fingerprint\" to enter the lair's electronic security. Director D has somehow gotten in the lair as well, and you will use the three password codes (LASER HAIR REMOVAL)to reactivate the transporter to the laser satellite. Unfortunately, D is a bald baddie himself. Follow him up to the satellite and will sic his mini-bot guards on you. Avoid the robot's zaps and lead it to a yellow power globe, which will send electricity through its plug and destroy it. Three more mini-bots will attack, and there are three more globes (two at the top of the room, two at the bottom). *IF THE GAME FREEZES : sorry, nothing to do but reset the game from when you entered the B.A.D. area. When his bots are destroyed, the evil director will begin zapping you with his flying control room. You will have to use the Bowtie to reach the top of his machine. Each time he flies into the ceiling to knock you loose, he will damage his machine. After 3 crunches, he is powerless and is taken into custody. You become a Director and get the island medal. Notes : When in the greenhouse (step 10), you should take off the Bowtie, to avoid using it accidentally. The jumping movement inside the B.A.D. hideout (step 12) is especially tough where the two lasers are firing at once. This may take several tries. "}

She\u2019s counting on most people not paying attention to the small details-weirdly, it seems so many don\u2019t. They just latch on and believe any dumb thing (and lie) that comes out of her mouth.
