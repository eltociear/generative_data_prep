{"prompt": " 2003 Acura TL type S", "completion": "I heard, if it was the 2nd half of the 2003 manufacturing cycle, they fixed it.\n\nAsk if they changed the trans fluid every 15k miles and filter 30k miles Yea he\u2019s telling me he changes the trans oil every year and just told me they had a recall a few years back and an Acura dealer took care of it so I guess it\u2019s all good The replacement warranty was a long time ago. 7 years or 107k miles, whichever came first. The replaced trans were rebuilt ones from the manuf and many complained about failures even with those. Get a dealer inspection before you buy\n\nIf you get it, change the filter, it's a really difficult job, but should be done on a schedule. Only use OEM trans fluid for the changes. Also, put a trans cooler on it Ok great, thank you I really appreciate the advice! "}
{"prompt": " Tuesday 12 July 2022 - 3G 60 Minutes - 12 Minute Run for Distance", "completion": "This was a surprise 5am 3g, as started on floor first so some of the names of the exercises might be out... will fix when the 2G is posted! thought you may get a 2G at 5am! 2G looks a little easier than the 3G.. nowhere as many lunges thankfully! We had a 1G and our coach's view was that the 3G was harder, so that's what 5am crew gets! Was probably best because we all started on the floor which was pretty easy. Thanks for the correct exercise names! "}
{"prompt": " Hearing Voices in Childhood HomeThis weekend, my husband and I are watching my parents\u2019 dogs while they\u2019re away. This is the same house I grew up in as a child. When I was a kid, my sister and I would hear things and would think someone was calling us when there wasn\u2019t. Even as young adults, that still happens sometimes when we\u2019re at the house. Then my husband thought he heard me calling him this weekend when I didn\u2019t. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and he\u2019s never done that before. Do you guys think that hearing voices only in this house is from something supernatural? As soon as I moved out a few years ago, I never had that problem again. It\u2019s only here in this house that happens", "completion": "How old is your house? Was your family the first to live there? The house was a built in the 70s and my parents are the second people to own it. The first owner was an old lady who\u2019s probably dead by now Thr land your house is on could have a history. My house was built I'm the 40s but my brother heard children laughing outside from the area the original house was on. We dont have neighbors. We suspect the land use to be a plantation. The land had been in the original family for 150+ years. Makes sense. The town my parents live in is almost 300 years old and it was named after Native Americans who were here before the pilgrims or whoever settled here "}
{"prompt": " Mirroring and BPDIs mirroring a comping mechanism or is it something we\u2019re prone to? Why is it that we have no sense of self identity and why is it so hard to find ourselves?

I have no clue where to start and how to go about things.", "completion": "Here is a strange medical fact for you.  The mirror neuron system is a part of your brain that helps you understand other people and their intentions.  Having BPD indicates a level of abuse where that system may malfunction and you would begin to confuse other people's feeling with your own.  Some people call that being an \"empath.\"\n\nThat said, BPD is also a disorder of the identity and you will need to learn who you really are. "}
{"prompt": "A third of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK have met someone in person they originally met through social media. The figure comes from an exclusive online Newsbeat poll of 1,015 British teenagers, put together by Comres. The survey also indicates that a quarter feel happier online than they do in real life. But overall, real-life relationships are still considered far more important than online ones, according to the findings. Sixty-six per cent polled last month said the number of friends they knew in person was more important to them, compared to 28% who said the same of the number of friends and followers they had online. The survey also suggests what lots of people know already, that social media is now an integral part of teenagers' lives. Only one per cent of _ said they never checked in online for social reasons. Facebook is the most popular social network (89% have an account), followed by Twitter (62%) and Snapchat (58%). Dr Emma Short, a psychologist at the University of Bedfordshire, said, \"The number of teenagers meeting up with people they first befriended online is worrying. Even very sophisticated security experts find it very hard to verify the identity of accounts. When you're 15 and you're very effective at identifying friends and risk, it's easy to assume you can do that online. It's not safe in that they may not be who they say they are and you know nothing about them apart from the conversation you've had online - which is a very small part of their lives and the person they may be.\" The survey also indicated: * 25% of teenagers admitted they were addicted to social media. * 25% wished they could give up social media. \"I can't do without my phone.\" says 17-year-old Aisha from Clapton, north London. \"I can't do without checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat.\" When we ask Aisha about the prospect of taking her social networks away, the consequences, genuinely, are too hard to bear. Jealousy, loneliness, happiness and stress are all emotions felt by teenagers. Which of the following best conveys Dr Emma Short's view ? 'The online friends teenagers meet in person are worrying', 'It's easy for 15-year-olds to make online friends', 'It's difficult for adolescents to identify online friends and risk' or 'The conversation with your virtual friends is helpful'?", "completion": "It's difficult for adolescents to identify online friends and risk."}
{"prompt": "After retiring from playing, he became trainer at Leeds City where he stayed for two seasons. Swift had a good deal of influence on onfield activities and gave manager Gilbert Gillies great support before taking the post of manager at Chesterfield in summer 1907. He spent three years at Chesterfield, with no conspicuous success. In his first season in charge, Chesterfield finished second from bottom of Football League Second Division but were re-elected. The following season (1908-09) they finished in the same position but this time failed to be re-elected. There then followed a season in the Midland League, where Chesterfield were champions at the end of the 1909-10 season. Swift left Chesterfield in May 1910 before moving south to become secretary-manager at The Dell in April 1911. Prior to Swift's appointment, The Saints had been \"managed\" by the board under the company secretary, Mr. E. Arnfield, with W. Dawson as trainer. The board had made a concerted effort to find a manager who could end the team's dreadful run of form (which had seen them drop to 17th place in the Southern League at the end of the 1910-11 season), and interviewed 140 applicants. Following the appointment of Swift, Dawson (who had been trainer for seventeen years) resigned and Armfield moved to financial secretary. In the first six weeks of Swift's brief reign he spent 820 recruiting 11 new players. Unfortunately, the appointment of a full-time manager failed to stop the rot and the 1911-12 season was another disappointment with the team finishing in 16th place, resulting in Swift's resignation.
