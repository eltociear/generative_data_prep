{"prompt": " Why are we not in for Sterling?", "completion": "He would completely break our wage structure I think that\u2019s being parroted around a bit too much. \n\nSterling couldn\u2019t obliterate our wage structure because we don\u2019t have a Sterling analogue to make anything close to him. And I don\u2019t just mean what he\u2019ll be asking but what they deserve. Unless saka really goes off, nobody will be able to point to Sterling even if he came here and say \u201cI want Sterling money\u201d it just isn\u2019t applicable, they\u2019d get laughed off. And when/if our guys do get there, we\u2019re gonna have to pay them or lose them\n\nThat being said I doubt this would ever happen for a lot of reasons "}

{"prompt": "A pretty good British film along the lines of Cliffhanger but without the ridiculous over the top action. It's more thriller suspense & more slow paced than Sly's movie but this doesn't stop being a decent entry into this genre. Five mountaineers are on a climbing holiday in the Scottish Highlands when they stumble across a young Serbian girl buried in an underground chamber. They become involved in a vicious cat & mouse chase with the kidnappers as they try to reach civilisation to alert the police. Is it likely that the person who wrote this review will recommend this movie to others?", "completion": "No"}
{"prompt": "It was the small hours of the morning when we reached London Airport. I had rung London from Amsterdam, and there was a hired car to meet, but there was one more unfortunate happening before I reached my flat. In all my travels I have never, but for that once, been required by the British customs to open a single bag or to do more than state that I carried no goods liable to duty, or rather, to declare. It was, of course, my fault; the extreme tiredness and nervous tension of the journey had destroyed my normal state of mind. I was, for whichever reason, so tired that I could hardly stand, and to the question, \"have you read this?\" I replied with extreme foolishness, \"Yes, hundreds of times.\" \"And you have nothing to declare?\" \"Nothing.\" \"How long have you been out of this country?\" \"About three months.\" \"And during that time you have acquired nothing?\" \"Nothing but what is on the list I have given you.\" He seemed momentarily at a loss, but then he attacked. The attack, when it came, was completely unexpected. \"Where did you get that watch?\" I could have kicked myself. Two days before, when playing water games with a friend in the bath, I had forgotten to take off my ROLEX OYSTER, and it had, not unnaturally, stopped. I had gone into the market and bought, for no more than ten pounds, an ugly time piece that made a strange noise. It had stopped twice, without any reason, during the journey. I explained, but I had already lost face. I produced my own watch from a pocket, and added that I should be grateful if he would _ the replacement. \"It is not a question of confiscation; you will have it,\" he said, \"there is a fine for failing to declare dutiable goods. And now may I please examine that Rolex?\" It took another quarter of an hour to persuade him that the Rolex was not contraband ; then he began to search my luggage. What can we conclude from the questions asked by the customs officer? 'He wanted to embarrass the writer', 'He was just fulfilling his duty by asking the passenger some usual questions', 'He must have noticed the writer's new watch' or 'He can't have noticed the writer's tiredness'?", "completion": "He must have noticed the writer's new watch."}
{"prompt": " A little over a year old, got him from a tough spot. Was told pure Aussie from the \u201cowner\u201d, but didn\u2019t figure so. 10/10 boy though, no matter what!", "completion": "Some photos he's a bit shorter legged and stockier like an Aussie... But in the first photo I thought he looked a bit more Border Collie. Coat type looks a bit more Border as well. I don't suspect he is anything outside herding breed though. The extensive white fur and lack of pigmentation around his eyes/nose, while this can happen in any merle, his makes me wonder if he is from a Merle to Merle breeding. Is he deaf or does he have any vision issues? No, he does have trouble finding out where whistling comes from. But he sees and hears just fine other than that. I always thought border or heeler mix. I didn\u2019t know if his hair would grow any longer with age. He could have some mild hearing loss, or loss only in the white ear. Can't say without proper testing of course. I don't think Heeler, coat looks a bit silky, soft and long for that. "}

{"prompt": "Ex-Google and Facebook employees launch a campaign to warn about the addictive dangers of the technologies they helped build Can you write an article that uses the previous text as a title?", "completion": "Technology experts worried about the dangers posed by social networks and smartphones are taking on the companies they helped to establish. Ex-Google and Facebook workers are campaigning to raise awareness of the negative effects of using products made by their former employers. Among their concerns are addiction to technology and its impact on individuals, particularly children and younger users, as well as society as a whole. Scroll down for video Tristan Harris, a former in-house ethicist at Google is spearheading the new group, called the Center for Humane Technology. The newly-launched initiative, which is working withthe nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, is planning to lobby the United States government over tech addiction. It is also undertaking an advertising campaign aimedat 55,000 public schools in the US, to raise awareness with parents, students and teachers over its concerns. These include the mental health effects of overuse of social media, including depression, stress, anxiety, self-image and self-worth, according to the group's website. The campaign, called The Truth About Tech, alsoseeks to address more wide-ranging problems caused by technology, including its power to influence our relationships and even our political beliefs. Speaking to the New York TimesMr Harris, said: 'We were on the inside.We know what the companies measure. We know how they talk, and we know how the engineering works. 'The largest supercomputers in the world are inside of two companies  Google and Facebook  and where are we pointing them? 'We're pointing them at people's brains, at children.' This is not the first time that a high profile figure from a technology company has expressed concerns over its products. In December,formerFacebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya spoke out against the social network he helped to create, saying it is 'ripping society apart'. MrPalihapitiya, who joined Facebook in 2007 and became its vice president for user growth, saidhe feels 'tremendous guilt' for the influence Facebook has had and its ability to manipulate users. He also suggested users take a break from using social media altogether. Facebook itself has admitted that the social network may pose a threat to democracy, through the spread of fake news. In a series of blog posts in January 2018, Facebook execs said the site was far too slow in identifying negative influences that rose with the 2016 US election, citing Russian interference, 'toxic discourse,' and the dangerous consequences of misinformation. The firm is set to roll out major changes to the News Feed, with plans to prioritise content from friends and family, and make posts from business, brands, and media less prominent  and, ensure the 'news people see, while less overall, is high quality.'"}
