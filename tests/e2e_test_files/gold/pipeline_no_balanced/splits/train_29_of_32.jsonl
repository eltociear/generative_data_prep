{"prompt": "While environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trading activity has been a distinctive feature of financial markets, the debate if ESG scores can also convey information regarding a company's riskiness remains open. Regulatory authorities, such as the European Banking Authority (EBA), have acknowledged that ESG factors can contribute to risk. Therefore, it is important to model such risks and quantify what part of a company's riskiness can be attributed to the ESG scores. This paper aims to question whether ESG scores can be used to provide information on (tail) riskiness. By analyzing the (tail) dependence structure of companies with a range of ESG scores, that is within an ESG rating class, using high-dimensional vine copula modelling, we are able to show that risk can also depend on and be directly associated with a specific ESG rating class. Empirical findings on real-world data show positive not negligible ESG risks determined by ESG scores, especially during the 2008 crisis. Does 'ESG, Risk, and (Tail) Dependence' summarize the core of the above text? 'Yes' or 'No'?", "completion": "Yes"}
{"prompt": " Max Ability Baste Seraphine Climbing me to Diamond 1 after lose streakLast season Grandmaster here, Seraphine main (otp but I also play Lux lol). I usually play Sera mid BUT I've actually been going Duo Lane Seraphine with so much success.\n\nBuild\nPre: Tear of the Goddess (Finish Seraphs Angel After Staff of Flowing Water)\n1st: Luden's Echo (huge power spike)\n2nd: Soulstealer (For your ultimate cool down, which is one of the best in the game)\n3rd: Staff of Flowing Waters (This item is getting a buff for Seraphine because of her long W cool down but it's going to last for 6 seconds)\n4th: Seraph's Embrace\n5th: Situational, but I like going for Banshee's Viel. Voidstaff if enemy goes too much MR. Or Rylai's for more utility and annoyance.\n\nBoots: Ionian Boots of Lucidity with Locket Enchant. I usually get this after building Luden's Echo.\n\nLate game I easily achieve 150+ Ability Haste. I'm basically playing URF Seraphine and she's already an S tier URF champion. Her ultimate cool down goes down to 20 SECONDS! 20 Seconds for literally one of the strongest ultimates in the game! It gives me the power to cast it aggressively instead of trying to save it since the cooldown goes by so quickly, and the enemies don't expect you to have it up so quickly. You still do damage because of how frequently you cast your abilities, but your utility is more important and Ability Haste is Seraphine's most important stat.\n\nTry out this build and thank me later \ud83d\ude18\n\nRunes:\nAery\nGathering Storm or Giant Slayer against Tanks\nConditioning\nThe Ability Haste Rune", "completion": "Just played w it. I love the ability haste focus. We lost but I tore it up. How low did you get your ult CD??? I don\u2019t remember but I was spamming skills a looot quicker than I was before, especially ult.
