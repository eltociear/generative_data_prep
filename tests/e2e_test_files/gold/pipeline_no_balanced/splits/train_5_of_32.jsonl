{"prompt": " Our DB, and it\u2019s potential fix!This isn\u2019t to brag. This is just another post in the sea of hundreds. This is about my experience, and what caused it, and how we overcame it. \n\nBack in December of 2021, my boyfriend was paying bills for two houses. The house he owned (House 1), and the house we lived in (House 2). His parents owned House 2, so we paid them. This is when our dead bedroom started. We were having sex maybe once every 9 days here. \n\nBills were high. Way less than they are now, but it was crazy enough that my boyfriend knew we couldn\u2019t go through another winter paying for two houses. We got renters in House 1 in January. That took some ease off. They paid just a little more than House 1 cost my boyfriend, so there was maybe ~$200 profit a month. Then interest rates and general bills began spiking. \n\nWe put House 1 on the market in March. We had a TON of showings. At least 27 in March alone. And no one was interested. So my boyfriend paid for House 1 to be renovated, about $15,000. So: bills were high, the house wasn\u2019t selling, and now he had new debt. Our DB was worse, and because I couldn\u2019t understand, our relationship was strained. \n\nMarch-May was a struggle. It was very hard. By the end of May, we had gone from sex once every two weeks, to not even cuddling and being physically affectionate with each other. \n\nJune, we began thinking we would have to move back to House 1. That all of the money my boyfriend had paid his parents for House 2 was pointless, that the debt he had taken on was pointless. We were being told that even if we sold House 1, we would not be approved for House 2. \n\nWe had sex maybe once in June. An early morning 15 minute quickies before work, before the stress of the day caught up to my boyfriend. \n\nJuly 17th, someone bought House 1. It fell through, was approved, fell through again, and finally bought it for $27K less than asking price. Ouch. Possession was July 27th! Yay! \n\nWe have had sex July 27th, 28th, and this morning. That is three days in a row. \n\nMy whole experience posting here, people have told me to end it. That it was not worth it. That him saying \u201cit\u2019s stress\u201d was a bullshit excuse. Maybe this is a pink cloud. Maybe this is just excitement. But even the way he walks seems less heavy now. \n\nMaybe it won\u2019t last. We might go back to once every 9 days, who knows? And maybe I sound foolish, talking about this. But we would all kill for three days in a row. And my love for him was never wavered. It had bent, and maybe rusted in a sore spot, but it was still solid. \n\nI didn\u2019t think my DB would end. I thought everyone here was right. That he didn\u2019t love me anymore, that we weren\u2019t meant to be, that he was a heartless asshole because he was manipulating me into making me trust him when he said he was sorry. \n\nBut I will take this victory. I will appreciate him, and try to take even more stress off his shoulders, and I will cherish every moment we spend together. When we had sex on the 27th, I cried and held him so tight. I love him so much. I have waited to have someone like him my whole life. \n\nDid those 7 months suck ass? Hell yeah! But those 7 months will be nothing compared to the rest of our lives together. \n\nIn the nicest way possible, I hope to never come back. Thank you everyone for your support. \n\nChiquitita.", "completion": "Congrats on your situation improving!\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 17 years and I\u2019ve NEVER had that frequency.  Even at the start it was once every 14-21 days. "}
{"prompt": "One of the fundamental properties of human languages is their sensitivity to relations among elements that are not easily characterized in linear terms. In phenomena like subject-verb agreement or reflexive anaphora, the relationship between the agreeing verb and its agreement target or the reflexive pronoun and its antecedent is not governed by linear properties like adjacency or recency, but instead by the hierarchical organization of the sentence. Similarly, the relationship between related sentences, which are represented in some grammatical theories as transformational operations or as lexical rules in others, is also governed by hierarchical organization. English polar questions, for instance, involve the fronting of an auxiliary verb in the corresponding declarative to a sentenceinitial position. Questions with complex subjects like (1a) demonstrate that the verb that is fronted in such cases is the determined by hierarchical prominence (i.e., MOVE-MAIN yielding (1b)) and not linear considerations or MOVE-LAST yielding (1d)). (1) a. [The president who can smile] will lead [those who would sing]. b. Will the president who can smile lead those who would sing? c. * Can the president who smile will lead those who would sing? d. * Would the president who can smile will lead those who sing? Chomsky (1971) argues that, in spite of receiving little input of the form in (1b), which would unambiguously demonstrate the necessity for a hierarchically governed dependency, children uniformly generalize the process of question formation in a hierarchical fashion. Such consistent behavior suggests that humans possess an inherent bias of some sort towards hierarchical generalization (though see Ambridge et al. (2008) and Perfors et al. (2011) for arguments against this view). Replicating such a bias in generalization would indicate the ability to mimic patterns of human cognition and learning. Previous investigations of recurrent neural architectures have yielded some evidence for hierarchically-governed linguistic knowledge (Gulordava et al., 2018; Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Hu et al., 2020) . Even greater success has been achieved with neural networks the incorporate explicit representation of syntactic structure (Kuncoro et al., 2018) . Architecturally-constrained models when trained without explicit information about syntactic structure show only modest benefits (Shen et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; . However, all of these studies involve models that are trained on large quantities of text which may not be impoverished in domains that these bench- The recently developed Transformer architecture has led to revolutionary advances across many areas of natural language processing, including machine translation and question answering (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019) . Transformerbased models have also shown considerable success on benchmarks that appear to require the representation of hierarchical abstractions (Rogers et al., 2021; Goldberg, 2019; Warstadt et al., 2019) . Further, investigations of Transformers' representations of sentences (Hewitt and Manning, 2019; Lin et al., 2019) point to encodings of hierarchical syntactic structure. Yet, for the reasons noted above, it is difficult to conclude much about the inductive bias in the Transformer: they are trained on vast datasets, leaving open the question of the impact of inductive bias as opposed to training data (Warstadt and Bowman (2020) , but see Van Schijndel et al. (2019) for arguments that even massive data may not be sufficient). This paper contributes to our understanding by examining the degree to which the Transformer architecture is biased toward hierarchical generalization when the data underdetermine such generalization. Specifically, we study whether Transformers learning sequence-to-sequence mappings generalize in a structure sensitive way, and compare their performance with recurrent models. Can you summarize the previous text?", "completion": "Natural language exhibits patterns of hierarchically governed dependencies, in which relations between words are sensitive to syntactic structure rather than linear ordering. While re-current network models often fail to generalize in a hierarchically sensitive way (McCoy et al.,2020) when trained on ambiguous data, the improvement in performance of newer Trans-former language models (Vaswani et al., 2017)on a range of syntactic benchmarks trained on large data sets (Goldberg, 2019; Warstadtet al., 2019) opens the question of whether these models might exhibit hierarchical generalization in the face of impoverished data.In this paper we examine patterns of structural generalization for Transformer sequence-to-sequence models and find that not only do Transformers fail to generalize hierarchically across a wide variety of grammatical mapping tasks, but they exhibit an even stronger preference for linear generalization than comparable recurrent networks"}

The veteran television anchor was pulled over by police near her home in East Hawthorn, Melbourne, in February. The single mother-of-four was breath-tested by police after having too many drinks before driving to her late father's empty house to remember him. 'I made an extremely poor error of judgement,' the 59-year-old told The Herald Sun. 'In all my years as a daughter, a mother, a broadcaster, a friend, a colleague, I've never done anything I've been truly ashamed of and regretted more.' The regional news reporter has been honest about her grief after the death of her father earlier this year. She was driving to his now-empty Box Hill home just 15 minutes away from where she was pulled aside for a breath test. The Nine Network said she they believe the much-loved presenterwill '100 per cent' not face court. Ms Hall has been working for the Nine Network for 40 years and is a regional presenter for Nine News Victoria. Given the events: 'Jo Hall said she is 'remorseful' after she was caught drink-driving in Melbourne', 'Mrs Hall has been honest about her grief over her father's death earlier this year', choose the one that follows 'The veteran news presenter was driving from Box Hill to East Hawthorn' according to the previous text.", "completion": "Mrs Hall has been honest about her grief over her father's death earlier this year"}
