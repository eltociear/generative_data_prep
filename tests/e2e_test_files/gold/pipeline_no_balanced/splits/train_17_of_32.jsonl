{"prompt": " Concrete is killing my roots!We recently moved into a new house with the entire backyard (not the biggest) is a paved concrete slab. My only option for a garden this year was in pots. The tomatoes and peppers are loving the warm roots but my figs and cannabis aren\u2019t huge fans. Just curious what others have done to combat this? I was thinking of just buying a couple small pieces of artificial turf but I\u2019m not sure if that will help with the heat. Open to many ideas!", "completion": "I would set the pots of the fig and cannabis pots up on \"feet\" of some sort (wood blocks?  bricks?) for a little air circulation.  There's not much else that you can do, given you are gardening on a concrete slab.  After the growing season you may want to consider taking some of the concrete out and replacing with planting beds, it's a lot healthier for the ground to be uncovered plus there's less concrete to absorb the heat and will also help to keep your home cooler.

By not pressing the Square/X/Y button (why can't controllers standardize buttons already), the 'left' button which normally sends it bumping into a wall or monster, once the button has been pressed the monster will eventually trip once you stop bumping into things for a few seconds i hold down the right button and move the left stick to actually make them move but they usually trip after a few steps. they just dont move if i dont do that Try holding the run button and moving the left stick while riding, then you can move them without tripping "}
{"prompt": "One of the challenges encountered by computational simulations at exascale is the reliability of simulations in the face of hardware and software faults. These faults, expected to increase with the complexity of the computational systems, will lead to the loss of simulation data and simulation failure and are currently addressed through a checkpoint-restart paradigm. Focusing specifically on computational fluid dynamics simulations, this work proposes a method that uses a deep convolutional neural network to recover simulation data. This data recovery method (i) is agnostic to the flow configuration and geometry, (ii) does not require extensive training data, and (iii) is accurate for very different physical flows. Results indicate that the use of deep image priors for data recovery is more accurate than standard recovery techniques, such as the Gaussian process regression, also known as Kriging. Data recovery is performed for two canonical fluid flows: laminar flow around a cylinder and homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For data recovery of the laminar flow around a cylinder, results indicate similar performance between the proposed method and Gaussian process regression across a wide range of mask sizes. For homogeneous isotropic turbulence, data recovery through the deep convolutional neural network exhibits an error in relevant turbulent quantities approximately three times smaller than that for the Gaussian process regression,. Forward simulations using recovered data illustrate that the enstrophy decay is captured within 10% using the deep convolutional neural network approach. Although demonstrated specifically for data recovery of fluid flows, this technique can be used in a wide range of applications, including particle image velocimetry, visualization, and computational simulations of physical processes beyond the Navier-Stokes equations.

{"prompt": "Diffusion broadening of spectral lines is the main limitation to frequency resolution in non-polarized liquid state nano-NMR. This problem arises from the limited amount of information that can be extracted from the signal before losing coherence. For liquid state NMR as with most generic sensing experiments, the signal is thought to decay exponentially, severely limiting resolution. However, there is theoretical evidence that predicts a power law decay of the signal's correlations due to diffusion noise in the non-polarized nano-NMR scenario. In this work we show that in the NV based nano-NMR setup such diffusion noise results in high spectral resolution. Is this text about 'Physics'? 'Yes' or 'No'?", "completion": "Yes"}
