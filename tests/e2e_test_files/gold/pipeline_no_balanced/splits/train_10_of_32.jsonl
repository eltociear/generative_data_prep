{"prompt": "An assist, a goal and the undisputed crown of man of the match. For Julian Draxler, Germany's 3-0 win over Slovakia could prove to be one of the most significant games yet in his career. The attacking midfielder has long been pursued by some of Europe's top clubs, and nearly signed for both Juventus and Arsenal in recent years. He chose a more modest move to Wolfsburg in the end. After his performance on Sunday, however, he may find that the big boys are about to come knocking again. 'It was a great day, a fantastic game,' said Draxler after victory over Slovakia. 'For me personally, it was huge.' Draxler, who kept his place in the team at the expense of Mario Gotze, was electrifying on Sunday. His unique, cantering runs kept the Slovakia back line in disarray. He ushered in the second goal, before scoring the third. 'Julian played very well today,' said Germany coach Joachim Low. 'He was great in training with his dribbling and one-on-ones. I told him he should be brave.' Not for the first time in this tournament, one of Low's decisions paid off brilliantly. Draxler and Gomez have paid their coach back for his sudden faith in them, while Low's decision to play Joshua Kimmich and Jonas Hector as wing backs has also been an undisputed success. Not just that, but his players' cylinders are now beginning to fire. The win against Slovakia might mark the moment in which Germany explode into this tournament. After quietly navigating the group phase, Low's side have now reached the quarter-final without conceding a single goal. Thanks to Low's tactical tinkering, things are beginning to work going forward as well. The possession based, high dynamic style that Low favours is now complemented by the wing backs and Mario Gomez's bullish presence in the area. 'The flexibility we have up front is incredible,' said Gomez on Sunday. Even off the pitch, Germany look formidable. When Jerome Boateng opened the scoring against Slovakia, he immediately raced to the bench to embrace team doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt. After taking a knock to his calf against Northern Ireland, Boateng recovered just in time to play Slovakia. 'Without the medical staff we have, I wouldn't have played,' he said. A watertight defence, an ever improving attack, a coach with the Midas touch and a brilliant medical department. It is little wonder Germany are the team to beat at Euro 2016. Given the events: 'Germany beat Slovakia 3-0 on Sunday to reach Euro 2016 quarter-finals', 'Julian Draxler and Mario Gomez have added an extra dimension in attack', choose the one that follows 'The world champions are yet to concede at Euro 2016 this summer' according to the previous text.", "completion": "Julian Draxler and Mario Gomez have added an extra dimension in attack"}
