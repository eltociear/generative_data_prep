{"prompt": "British motorists are currently being encouraged to trade their old diesel cars for low-emissions models with scrappage schemes offered by the biggest manufacturers. Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Renault and VW have all recently launched scrappage incentives offering discounts of anything between 1,000 and 8,000 off a new, more efficient car when you hand over an older pre Euro 5-emissions vehicle registered before the end of 2009. But there are some diesels built before 2010 that you should cling onto, just because they are that good. While the value of some used diesel cars might be in decline, there are some 'performance' diesels that are still great - even by today's standards - and could potentially rise in value. Petrolhead and automotive expert with car parts sellers MicksGarage.com, Rob King, identified 10 diesels hes convinced could be worth more in the future than they are now. And hes urging owners to keep them on British roads rather than panic sell or trade them in as part of the industry-wide scrappage schemes being offered by manufacturers. He explained: 'Some old and decrepit diesels clearly need putting out of their misery. Others, however, deserve preserving as examples of pure automotive brilliance. 'Every time a new scrappage scheme comes into play, we also see some really iconic, and often rare, cars disappearing from UK roads. For many car enthusiasts, its a sad thing. And there are many diesels which absolutely deserve to be nurtured, pampered and repaired, not crushed to oblivion.' Heres his pick of the die hard diesels: Boasting what was the most powerful diesel engine BMW sold in the UK, the 335d is very fast, but also usable on a daily basis. Its rear-wheel-drive, and available in a touring version too. This is the ultimate sleeper - a car with high performance but an unassuming exterior. And what car enthusiast woulndt want a V10! Theres 345bhp from a 5 litre V10 might not sound a lot but 850nm of torque sure is. Thats more than most trucks. A luxury mile-muncher thats starting to become affordable as depreciation kicks in. Its also cooler than a BMW 5 series or Mercedes-Benz E class. Despite the stunning design and reasonable reviews it's a rare occurrence to see an RCZ on the roads, especially a diesel one, which means in a few years time it could be fast-tracked into the ranks of future classics. Why would you keep this diesel Alfa? Given a list of titles: 'Female, 40, flabby and fed up?

{"prompt": "It is shown that in a single-axis antiferromagnetic semiconductor placed in a strong magnetic field, dispersionless magnons start emitting at any arbitrarily small velocity of an electron occurring in a spinpolaron state.

{"prompt": "Sprout your greens for a more substantial project. Your task is to detail the above headline and write a paragraph of around 128 words.", "completion": "The process for starting a small batch of microgreens like wheatgrass, pea shoots, or sunflower greens is remarkably similar, though slightly more equipment-intensive, than sprouting in your kitchen. You'll be able to trim multiple high-yield crops of sprouting greens from these projects, however, making them a good investment, especially if you're into wheatgrass shots or fresh shoots on your salad. Start your sprouts like normal, soaking wheat seeds, green peas, or sunflowers in a jar and letting them sprout for about before rinsing them thoroughly and moving them to a seeding tray. Sprouts need to have about quarter-inch roots showing before you move them to the seeding tray. Depending on what you're going to plant, this may take a varying amount of time, possibly 3 or 4 days."}
{"prompt": " The road to building my JG Bar 10 G-SpecHello all! Im gonna use this as a form of journal keeping for any builds, but Im going to start with my JG Bar 10, the famous TM VSR 10 clone. \n\nI got this gun barely used on Hopup, 3 mags and all for $150. So I learned that you're supposed to go backward. I have the trigger unit all stock, cylinder, barrel, etc. I just got my newest upgrades in from the mail. Am Action army Hopup chamber for really cheap at $30 and a laylax hop up rubber. Installed without a hitch.\n\nAirseal seams better air seams to strike out harder. the range seems better The bb doesn't seem to drop so soon. So I can say this upgrade was a slam dunk.  Next upgrade will be my trigger assembly and a better inner barrel. But mainly a TDC kit because hop up adjustment is a bitch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any other 2 cents on what I should do next, then that would be greatly appreciated.", "completion": "The Masada hop arm is a must for the AA hop chamber. Such a good upgrade. A weighted piston is always a good idea for snipers, right now I have a custom made brass one but the really good weighted pistons in order are: edgi sap, wasp, stalker. They are all good.\n\nFor trigger just get the Springer custom works one. It's just  so good. \n\nGunna need a new spring guide, get a 9mm spring guide and run 13mm springs, it'll give you a smoother and easier bolt pull.\n\nFor the cylinder you can go for an expensive AA or laylax one but I have been using the new maple leaf V2 cylinders and have no complaints. Plus it's like \u00a340 cheaper.\n\nFor barrel I keep switching between a PDI and the stock TM one that I lapped. Both are great, if you really want to push it edgi is the way.\n\nDon't forget to take a look at sorbo pads, the main benefits for snipers other than range is how quite they are so any way to make em quieter is great. \n\nI would also recommend doing the carbon tube mod, blind sniper made a video on his yt how to do it "}
{"prompt": " Adrift amongst catheters and total joint protocolsSo, I am a newer grad (graduated 2020), working in a small rural outpatient hospital currently. I have previously worked for a small rural outpatient clinic. Over the past couple of months I have become increasingly disenfranchised with the healthcare system and physical therapy in general. I enjoy the empowerment of physical activity and advocating for overall wellness. However, it has become increasingly taxing to deal with the bureaucracy of the healthcare system, insurances, and the frustrations of documentation. All of this has led me to question if physical therapy is the right career choice for me. Or if there is another wellness related career that I would be better suited for. I am in search of some sage old wisdom from those who have survived this profession longer than I or those who might offer a different vantage point. Thank you!", "completion": "In the first 10 years of my career I worked 4 places, I settled down in an acute care hospital and decided to invest in myself.

Which is nice don\u2019t get me wrong, but there are certifications I would love to pursue outside of that. Additionally, have you found ways of making the best out of the hospital politics? I find myself getting frustrated with the hospital bureaucracy. "}
