{"prompt": " Any interest in a 19th century Era save?I'm in the process of fleshing out a save file that is all 19th century style builds. I plan to Compile a mix of gallery builds and sims (credit given of coarse) with my own, and some EA made over townies. \n\nIf anyone is interested in having their Builds or sims living in a 19th century build that will be shared for free once complete tag me on the gallery origin name: rocknmomma or tag your creation with #rocknmommasave  suggestions for the sims stories are likely to be incorporated. \n\nHouses don't have to be victorian style, can be cottages and other build styles from that time. \n\nFinal product will be a save where all worlds (except San myshuno) are rebuilt to have 19th century homes and community lots, sims dressed in Era style attire, storylines and there will be an available Tray folder with a bunch of sims for MCCC to use for townie spawning to prevent ugly/modern townies. There won't be CC or mods being run while it is being built. MCCC will be used to quickly flesh out relationships and storyline then removed and restarted and play tested prior to sharing. \n\nI'm currently figuring out all the details running in a modded save file with getting MCCC to spay townies correctly. And building a collection of workable gallery builds and characters. \n\nIf yall are interested in this let me know. Its something I wanted but couldn't find a current version with all the world's with. If there is an interest I will seriously work to get it out instead of slowly building it like I am now lol", "completion": "I'm not much of a builder but I'll gladly steal the save off your hands (if that's even possible) once you're done A save file can be shared so long as you are on PC.

{"prompt": "For various reasons it has become quite difficult to accurately assess reserves on more than simple loan instruments, and this plus the regional differences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the global BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did set some standards which favoured lending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit corporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. These distinctions reflecting classical economics were superseded by policies relying on undifferentiated market values - more in line with neoclassical economics.

{"prompt": " Is PC building affordable again?", "completion": "So if the goal is VMs, I'm almost tempted to say 5950x over 12900k, since if you are dedicating a set number of cores to each vm it gets harder to allocate the E cores, vs a 5950 where you just have 16 regular cores. Also, are you switching out the memory and power supply out? Would think you could keep those. Thank you!\n\nI was going to keep the power supply. I didn\u2019t think 32gbs would be enough so I was gonna opt for 64 Yeah, that seems pretty decent. with 64gb you can have essentially 4 sets of quad core 16gb machines. welp. Thanks for the help today :) seems like that solves it "}
