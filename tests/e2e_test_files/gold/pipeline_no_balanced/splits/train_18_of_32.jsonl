{"prompt": " Rapture ReadyOne of my distant relatives visited today and started talking about her new favorite news source (if it may be called that) called rapture ready. It apparently shows news and tells how it contributes to the rapture. Disturbing that there is such an official outlet for such a thing. I would look into it but I don\u2019t want to relive rapture anxiety. I am surprised that this is the first time I\u2019ve heard of this.", "completion": "I was a teen in the late 90s/early 2000s. The internet wasn't as popular back then, but the rapture and end times talk sure was, especially the Left Behind books. People consumed information differently but this kind of misinformation was around big time then too. I actually LOVED those books. I think I\u2019m about five years older than you, though. But I thought they were fascinating. I have a much different opinion about them now, but I recently watched The Leftovers (which I also loved for very different reasons) and thought a lot about that book series. I'm looking up The Leftovers now! \n\nI also liked the Left Behind books, strangely enough. I was a teen but pretty confident in my own faith, but not super preachy/evangelical. I'm really glad I was outside the bubble enough to not be pushed into mission trips, camps, training programs, etc. I never did a mission trip because I got knocked up as a teenager (but an old enough teenager to not feel pressured to \u201capologize\u201d in front of the whole congregation for seducing a boy and becoming impregnated like some other girls did). My brother and sister each did mission trips, though, and I went to plenty of church camps and whatnot. I hope you like The Leftovers - it has such a great way of juxtaposing believers\u2019 and nonbelievers\u2019 views. "}
