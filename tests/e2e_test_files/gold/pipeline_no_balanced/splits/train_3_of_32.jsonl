{"prompt": " How GOOD is Jules Kounde \u25cf Tactical Analysis | Skills", "completion": "Does pretty much lock us into a back 3 for the foreseeable future. Wouldn\u2019t really cut it as part of a 2 in the PL. Him and Reece on the same side is going to be good to watch. I just worry that our attacking system is going to be stale and we\u2019ll be relying on defenders for creativity again. \n\nLeaves players like Mount and Gallagher a bit lost position wise, as neither are really technical or quick enough to be wingers or attacking midfield players I think we need to switch up between a 343 and 433 more often this year to keep teams on their toes. Like, if we play a weaker opposition we should be running a 433 to get more attacking players on the pitch. I believe that will help us avoid that string of draws we went on last season in early 2022. Tuchel preferred a 4-4-2/4-2-2-2 at psg, would probably see that rather than 4-3-3 Anything other than 3 ATB. I just think that playing 3 ATB limits our attack so much.

{"prompt": "Atomic-scale helices exist as motifs for several material lattices. We examine a tight-binding model for a single one-dimensional monatomic chain with a p-orbital basis coiled into a helix. A topologically nontrivial phase emerging from this model supports a zero-energy mode localized to a boundary, always embedded within a continuum band, regardless of termination site. We identify a topological invariant for this phase that is related to the number of zero energy end modes by means of the bulk-boundary correspondence, and give strict conditions for the existence of the bound state. Another, non-topological, gapped edge mode in the model spectrum has practical consequences for surface states in e.g. trigonal tellurium and selenium and other van der Waals-bonded one-dimensional semiconductors.
