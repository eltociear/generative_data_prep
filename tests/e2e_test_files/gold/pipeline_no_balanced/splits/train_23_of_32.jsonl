{"prompt": "Donald Trump and his White House team have been accused of breaking federal laws by using hidden messaging apps. An ethics watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a lawsuit against the president and his Executive Office on Thursday alleging they are not acting in compliance with federal records retention laws. 'President Trump and others within the White House are either ignoring or outright flouting these responsibilities,' the suit from CREW states. 'From early on in this Administration, White House staff have used and, on information and belief, continue to use certain email messaging applications that destroy the contents of messages as soon as they are read, without regard to whether the messages are presidential records.' It then cited Trump's controversial Twitter account, which the suit claimed is also legally problematic due to some of the president's posts being deleted. 'Presidential statements made on Twitter sent from the Presidents personal Twitter account, which are subject to federal record-keeping obligations, have been destroyed. 'These actions by the Defendants, which have prevented federal agencies from complying with their statutory responsibilities, violate the constitutional requirement that the President take care that the law be faithfully executed. 'As a further consequence, this regime increases the likelihood that valuable historical records of this presidency are already lost, and will continue to be lost, to Plaintiffs and the public, absent injunctive and declaratory relief.' The suit cites media reports to back up its allegations about Trump's staff using apps such as Signal and Confide to communicate in a more secretive manner. The Washington Postreported in February staffers within the White House were specifically using Confide, an app that immediately destroys messages after the are read. The Wall Street Journal reported in January Trump staffers and associates, including Roger Stone, used Signal. 'This destruction occurs with no independent assessment by the message sender or recipient of whether the message constitutes a presidential record,' the suit states. It then added Trump and his team have 'do not have adequate policies in place' to stop similar deleting apps being used. Internal White House messages and communications must be made available to the public five years after a president leaves office, as per presidential records laws. The National Security Archive at George Washington University joined CREW in the suit. Trump himself has been a vocal critic of politicians deleting messages, as he frequently leveled that allegation against Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Select a headline for the previous text.

{"prompt": " LDS Church Annual Finances", "completion": "When I worked for church IT they specifically told us in orientation that it was all paid via the for-profit/investment ventures of the church and not from tithing. Given lack of transparency and ability to muddy things accounting wise, I really have no idea how to even take what they said.\n\nIs the 6 billion just tithing expenditures, or is it everything excluding their for-profit businesses? As for the for profit companies:\n\nDeseret News - they must be losing money like all other newspapers do. They keep it because it is important for church PR \n\nKSL probably makes some money\n\nBeneficial Life has been effectively closed. No new sales of insurance for many years. \n\nDMBA is health insurance for church employees only. \n\nAgriculture- not huge profits each year. \n\nReal Estate - profitable\n\nThe net profits from these may be part of the $7 B inflows not sure. But I suspect it\u2019s less than $500M per year Interesting, honestly I had always excluded the for profit stuff when thinking about the church\u2019s finances in my head. Certainly their investments in stocks and bonds would be considered \u201cnon-operating income/losses\u201d. These can go up and down with the markets but over the long period generally go up. "}
