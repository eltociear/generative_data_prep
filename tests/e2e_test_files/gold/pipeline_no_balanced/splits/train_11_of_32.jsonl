{"prompt": " A close up of hand held electronic warfare rifle called the STUPOR that allows for disrupting and landing combat drones for capture and destruction.", "completion": "I doubt this works in practice. The amount of energy needed to produce enough signal disruption in a targeted area is pretty sizable. This thing doesn\u2019t appear to have anything that would store that amount of capacitance for any extended duration. So maybe it works for a few minutes but after that you\u2019re just LARPing as Master Chief or some shit It does work and doesn't take much energy, you can take down multiple drones from a single battery.  I was given a practical demonstration of a similar CUAS rifle.  It does more than just broad-spectrum jamming. Got anywhere I can read into that? Ok, so I can't find much that would help you.  But what I can say is that a lot of the drones being used are just modified commercial drones and these have vulnerabilities in the control systems that can be exploited to cause the drone to land on the spot.  Some military drones don't have the same vulnerabilities so have to be taken down by other means. So I\u2019m usually pretty skeptical of information without verifiable sources. However, I am seeing some info about *commercial* drones being able to be taken down with relatively mild power draw from signal jammers. So it may be that these devices are specifically for small civilian drones exclusively. \n\nThere are still questions about range, the accuracy of the user and duration of use that all play into eachother and are unresolved for answering how long one of these systems can be used for. Furthermore, when on the front line there is the question of recharging these weapons. Is it via battery pack? Well I don\u2019t see an easy way to pull out and put back in a fresh battery. Is it rechargeable via internal batteries? Well where in the trenches do you get that amount of power? Finally, how would these systems fair against a dual band or phased connection? I don\u2019t know if these have the ability to send out different bands of interference. Even if you could disrupt a drone there are ways you can program it to do something else than just land, like return to home. You can get a couple hours of aggregated use per battery, so enough for a day in the field.  I don't know about these particular CUAS devices but some have field replaceable batteries.\n\nFor range, if you can see the drone, these devices can hit it.  For accuracy, these aren't laser devices, they have high gain antennae.  the main lobe, whilst being highly directional is conical.  So if you point it in the direction of the drone, the drone will almost definitely receive the signal.\n\nThey are able to transmit at multiple frequencies, so that's not really an issue and when coupled with a UAS detection system you can tell what frequency you need to target.\n\nYes, some drones will return to home, but that takes away the immediate threat.\n\nOn the whole they are very effective, if they weren't militaries wouldn't still be using them.
