{"prompt": "Jores Okore slams Aston Villa boss Eric Black for claiming defender refused to play against Bournemouth Given the previous title, write a news story related to it.", "completion": "Aston Villa defender Jores Okore has hit out at caretaker manager Eric Black over claims he refused to play for the crisis-hit club. The Danish centre-back reacted angrily to comments from Black who claimed he had refused to be on the bench against Bournemouth. The 23-year-old, was left out of the squad to face Southampton on Saturday with Black suggesting he had asked not to play for the rest of the season. But Okore tweeted on Sunday: I refuse to play?, I was on the bench against Chelsea and the games before, why didn't I refuse to play those games? 'There must be more to it then MR. Eric Black is telling you!' Black said that he banished Okore to Aston Villas Under 21 squad after the defender effectively went on strike. Dane Okore had accused caretaker boss Black of sending him to train with the kids following a verbal bust-up. However, Black insisted that Okore withdrew his services when he discovered he was going to be on the bench against Bournemouth. In a week which has seen the club relegated, striker Gabby Agbonlahor suspended and owner Randy Lerner releasing a bizarre statement, the Okore incident is just another addition to the pile-up of problems. The player will not figure in the match against Southampton and seems set to stay with the U21s squad until the end of the season. Black insisted:It wasnt a disagreement. I spoke to Jores the week beginning the Bournemouth game and I thought he responded well and thought he trained extremely well. But once I named the 11 on the Friday, Jores asked to see me and said that he didn't want to be considered to be on the bench, which I found surprising. I withdrew him from the squad. I met him again on the Monday. He said he didnt want to be considered for any of the games going forwards. At that point I really didn't have a choice apart from remove him. I don't want people who don't want to be at Aston Villa and the Bournemouth game was a massive game for us. So he has gone to the Under-21s and that's what happens. The defender has not featured in the past two senior squads and last turned out for Villa in the 2-0 home defeat by Tottenham.Joleon Lescott and Ciaran Clark are the preferred centre-half partnership. The last 18 months have been tough for Okore."}
