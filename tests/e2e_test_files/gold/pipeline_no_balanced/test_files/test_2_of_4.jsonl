{"prompt": " We Are Not Party Animals. But...My husband and I are retired. Ten o'clock is a good bed time for us. We like seeing friends, we like going out to eat, although we got out of the habit of both during the Plague Times. We're not party animals.\n\nBut damn. I'm getting tired of not being able to leave the house together. One of us has to be home with the goblin. (Riot, 14-week-old shih-tzu.) He's getting better about being crated or penned, but he's not at the point where he'll tolerate it any longer than *he* wants to, i.e. as long as we'd like him to be crated. We don't expect a lot; maybe 2 hours? But he'll stay in the crate while he's asleep, and he'll wait for a while to be freed from cruel captivity, but then the shrieking begins. He will not wait calmly to get out at a time of our choosing.\n\nI'd like to go out to dinner, or a movie or something. But we can't. Does anyone have any tips about increasing the length of time he'll stay in the crate? We can't leave him in his pen or in a closed room for the same reasons. Eventually it'll turn into Scream XIII, plus he's not totally house-broken yet.\n\nHelp?", "completion": "He's still wee.  Start by leaving him alone while you are in the house, start small like 30 seconds, 60 seconds and work up to a longer duration.  If you can only get to 60 seconds, stay there for a decent amount of time and then slowly start to increase.  Don't jump too far too fast.  Lots of treats and crate games during the day and times you are around.  Don't only use the crate for crating.  Make the crate a magical place where he gets a special treat.  \n\nOur puppy is 6 mths and he regularly sleeps in his pen with crate attached fine.  He will sleep for up to 3 hrs so we go out during those naps.  We left him 1x recently where we put him into the pen and just left while he was still awake.  It was for dinner and we weren't gone longer than 1.5 hrs.  He whined a bit and then just rested and eventually slept.  \n\nAt 14 weeks, there's no way he would have coped with us leaving for a long periods unless he was already napping.  I was still doing small breaks from him during the day ie leave him in pen or gated area while I go upstairs or downstairs to laundry or outside quickly etc.  We practiced that a lot. "}

{"prompt": "Joliat finished his career with 270 goals and 460 points in 655 games. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947. In 1985, Joliat skated around the Montreal Forum to a huge ovation as a \"special treat\" for the fans. Despite falling twice, he quickly stood up and finished his skate, the trademark black cap he wore back in his playing days jauntily held in his hand, his white hair flying. Joliat continued to skate along Ottawa's Rideau Canal well into his 80s and died at the age of 84 in 1986; after seeing his beloved Canadiens win their 23rd Stanley Cup earlier that year and was buried in Notre Dame Cemetery in Ottawa, Ontario.
