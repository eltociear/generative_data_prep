{"prompt": " Civilian PoolSorry if this belongs in the \u201cwhat are my chances\u201d megathread. \n\nMy brother in-law graduated from college about a year ago. He started talking to enlisted recruiters for the Air Force and they kept telling him that there hasn\u2019t been a civilian picked officer in years. I thought this was a bit of Bull but I haven\u2019t been able to find anything to confirm or deny it. Now he\u2019s going enlisted and was told to apply in a year. As a veteran myself I know that the recruiters goal in the end is to get people into boot camp, and most bend the truth. So I was hoping anyone here can say that they\u2019re from the Civi side and they were picked recently. \n\n*note* not looking to out any recruiter or pull any shenanigans, my Brother in-law made his choice. This is mostly for my own curiosity. \n\nThanks", "completion": "There\u2019s an af ots page on FB a bunch got picked up. Idk why an enlisted recruiter would even try to play him like that. It worked. He leaves Monday and doesn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore so not much I can do. Wow nooooo he doesn\u2019t have to go anywhere a civilian ots package is so much easier. But if he\u2019s golden then he\u2019ll no problem going from enlisted to officer. Despite the fact that current enlisted have the lowest selection rate? It\u2019s not impossible if he has a good and does what he\u2019s supposed to. But you\u2019re right selection rates are low but our hiring pull just got smaller, ppl not really tryna join. No I\u2019m with you on that, it\u2019s just statistically the worst way to try and get there. Iv seen people get out after non selection and reapply to get in on their first try. "}

{"prompt": "At least seven people have died as bitter cold and gusty winds swept across the eastern United States after heavy snow over the weekend. The National Weather Service had forecast that temperatures would be more than 20 degrees below normal across the Northeast, with wind gusts up to 30 mph and wind chills approaching minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius)in northern New York state and Vermont. Atop the Northeasts highest mountain, the temperature fell to minus 23 degrees (minus 31 Celsius) Monday morning and dropped to minus 31 (minus 35 Celsius) later in the afternoon, according to the Facebook page for Mount Washington Observatory, in New Hampshire. Wind chills were hovering around minus 80 (minus 62 Celsius). In New York, Coast Guard crews moved quickly to rescue a 21-year-old man left stranded on an island in the Navensink River after his small boat broke down. The Coast Guard said two members waded through 34-degree (1 Celsius) water to bring the man to safety. The air temperature was 7 degrees (minus 14 Celsius) with 30 mph wind. 'Cold water and below freezing temperatures can complicate rescues like this and turn a bad situation to worse very fast,' said Commander Rich Sansone, search and rescue co-ordinator for Coast Guard Sector New York. The weather contributed to multiple deaths over the long Martin Luther King Jr holiday weekend. In suburban Chicago, the temperature was about 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Sunday when a 12-year-old girl died after a snow fort collapsed on her. Police in Arlington Heights, Illinois, said Esther Jung had been playing with another girl outside Rothem Church. Their families began looking for them about an hour later and found them under the snow. The younger girl survived. In Connecticut, a utility company subcontractor died on Sunday after being struck by a falling tree while working on a power line in Middletown. More than 10,000 homes and businesses in the state remained without power on Monday afternoon, down from a high of more than 25,000 outages on Sunday as temperatures dropped below zero in some locations. 'This is a reminder of the danger these men and women face on our behalf,' governor Ned Lamont said in a tweet. 'While many are still out there working today, please join me in acknowledging them and sending our thoughts to this person's family.'

{"prompt": " Struggled to gain weight for most of my life, now I keep gaining like crazy? I gain more than 1kg on a monthly basis starting 2022. It seems like my weight gain speed is only growing exponentially?\n\nIn 2021, it was fractions of a kg per month. And the odd thing is, I didn't really do anything to make it that way? Before the pandemic started, I was on calorie trackers forcing myself to eat more than 2000 calories a day. I was below 50kg (5'4 height).  Then when it started, I forgot all about it.\n\n\nIs it the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle? Is it because I unknowingly ate more food? Is it because I'm more stressed now (just graduated out of college, taking full-time WFH jobs)?\n\n\nUnderstandably, I did get what I've been asking for and maybe it's tone deaf for me to be complaining when it's what most of this people on this sub has been wanting, but I'm a bit puzzled about this.
