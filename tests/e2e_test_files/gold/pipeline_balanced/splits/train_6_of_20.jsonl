Passage: The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated \"Yamacraw Island\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world.\nConroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river.\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\nThis film was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia and used pupils from C.B. Greer Elementary school as the cast of students.", "target": "How do the Yamacraw Island inhabitants say the name of Jon Voight's character?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Other works that followed continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of \u00c9luard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite fran\u00e7aise. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the \u00c9cole Normale in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's Cinq po\u00e8mes de Paul \u00c9luard. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the \"three great meetings\" of his professional career, the other two being \u00c9luard and Landowska. In Johnson's words, \"for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc's counsellor and conscience\", and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as \"the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits\". In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works. Quatre motets pour un temps de p\u00e9nitence (Four Penitential Motets, 1938\u201339) and the song \"Bleuet\" (1939), an elegiac meditation on death, contrast with the song cycle Fian\u00e7ailles pour rire (Light-Hearted Betrothal), which recaptures the spirit of Les biches, in the opinion of Hell.", "target": "What was the last name of the person who starred in La Reine Margot?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: The area where Tulsa now exists was considered Indian Territory when it was first formally settled by the Lochapoka and Creek tribes in 1836. They established a small settlement under the Creek Council Oak Tree at the present day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. This area and this tree reminded Chief Tukabahchi and his small group of the Trail of Tears survivors of the bend in the river and their previous Creek Council Oak Tree back in the Talisi, Alabama area. They named their new settlement Tallasi, meaning \"old town\" in the Creek language, which later became \"Tulsa\". The area around Tulsa was also settled by members of the other so-called \"Five Civilized Tribes\" who had been relocated to Oklahoma from the Southern United States. Most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the Cherokee and Osage Nations.\nAlthough Oklahoma was not yet a state during the Civil War, the Tulsa area saw its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah took place on the north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction treaties with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.", "target": "What group of people named their new settlement Tallasi?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: \"Shine\" is a reggae pop and ska song that lasts three minutes and 24 seconds. It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \"crawling beat\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \"mellow beat\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \"party-vibe production\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \"child whisperer\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \"Shine!\" and Williams screaming \"Hey!\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\" and \"that bear with the red hat\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \"Pharrell's 'Happy\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \"without sounding overly patronizing\". \"Shine\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics. Williams was more \"specific\" regarding the lyrics as he wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like \"bear\", \"Paddington\", and \"station\"; Stefani said that she preferred for the song to be a \"little more abstract\". She later reversed this view, saying that she agreed with Williams' interpretation after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the Paddington Bear character. In an interview with American Top 40, Stefani credited Williams as being central to the recording's development, saying that he was \"the one who really got in there and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen\".", "target": "In an interview with what publication did the artist who had the tone of a \"child whisperer\" credit Williams as being central to the recording's development?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849\u20131928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 \u2013 c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864\u20131953), Jesse Godley (1862\u20131889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880\u201390), George Reynolds (c. 1839\u201389), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work\u2014no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.\nThe positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Sc\u00e8ne d'\u00e9t\u00e9, painted in 1869 by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille (1841\u201370). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures\u2014posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fianc\u00e9e\u2014in a pastoral landscape.", "target": "What was the name of the person that painted The Old Swimming Hole?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

B. \"Septic\" Baird, is landing his Hawker Hurricane at \"Pimpernel\" Squadron's airfield. Just as he touches down, however, a straggler from an earlier mission taxis across his path. Septic's quick reactions allow him to \"leapfrog\" the other Hurricane, averting a costly disaster. His action, however, causes him to crash his replacement aircraft into the bungalow of Squadron Leader Barry Clinton at the end of the runway.\nThis earns Septic the wrath of his new squadron leader, Bill Ponsford, because he damaged his fighter aircraft. The crash also injures the ligaments in Septic's neck, which he is able to self-diagnose, as he had been a medical student before the war. The next morning, Septic is told by Group Captain \"Tiger\" Small that he will not be able to fly until his neck is healed, so he will instead serve in the operations room for the time being.\nSeveral days later, with the risk of a bombing attack on the airfield, and all of Pimpernel Squadron's Hurricanes scrambled, Tiger orders all aircraft to take off and fly out of harm's way until the raid is over. With Tiger quickly assembling all available pilots and finding aircraft to fly, Septic wins a foot race with Small to claim the last spare Hurricane for himself. He then proceeds to shoot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 from the attacking force. His delight is short lived however when he is admonished by Small and Sqn Ldr Peter Moon for leaving his radio set to transmit, preventing the returning Hurricanes from being diverted to an undamaged airfield.

Passage: Rolling Stone named \"Single Ladies\" the best song of 2008, and wrote, \"The beat ... is irresistible and exuberant, the vocal hook is stormy and virtuosic.\" \"Single Ladies\" ranked as the second-best song of the 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and Rolling Stone critics placed it at number 50 on the list of the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. \"Single Ladies\" was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it \"hyperactive and supercharged in ways I never thought possible. It's epic and sexy and even a bit sad.\" \"There is absolutely zero chance Beyonc\u00e9 ever releases a single like this ever again\", Montgomery concluded. Time magazine's critic Josh Tyrangiel, who called the song \"ludicrously infectious\", ranked it as the seventh-best song of 2008. Douglas Wolf of the same publication placed it at number nine on his list of the All-Time 100 Songs.\"Single Ladies\" appeared at number six on the Eye Weekly's critics' list of the Best Singles of 2008, and at number six on About.com's Mark Edward Nero's list of the Best R&B Songs of 2008. On The Village Voice's year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, \"Single Ladies\" was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. \"Single Ladies\" was named the best song of the 2000s decade by Black Entertainment Television (BET).
