Ayrton Senna, before the San Marino Grand Prix, during which he suffered a fatal crash.\nOne of my best friends has been killed on the curve where I escaped death. I was lucky; he wasn't. It's like having a cheque book. You start pulling out the pages until one day no pages are left. He was the one driver so perfect nobody thought anything could happen to him. Gerhard Berger, Formula 1 driver, on Ayrton Senna.\nIt was at the bottom of our hearts to dedicate this victory to our great friend, Ayrton Senna. He was also heading for his fourth title.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "One of our memorials is missing a sword.\nThe General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.\nThe northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman \u2014 whose hands close upon empty air.\nWhen I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.\nThere was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a missing sword \u2014 a fact later verified in The Post\u2019s Oct. 16, 1903, edition, which included a drawing showing the soldier with a sword, its point touching the ground.\nThe lost sword is probably rusting in somebody\u2019s attic or slowly corroding in a landfill. I doubt even Holmes could find it now."}
