{"prompt": "", "completion": "How can I teach my toddler to do things independently?\nYou\u2019ve probably become more patient since you started this whole parenthood thing. And you\u2019re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.\nFor example, she tells you she can\u2019t finish the puzzle she\u2019s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you\u2019re going to have to tell her you\u2019ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she\u2019s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time.\nRemember that children each progress at their own rate. It\u2019s not always fast \u2014 and there will be setbacks along the way. But the more you can allow them to do on their own without stepping in, the more they\u2019ll be likely to try for themselves again and again."}
