{"prompt": "", "completion": "In light of recent accounting scandals, there are widespread calls for the UK competition authority to re-examine the audit market. Yet spending a substantial amount of resources on a market investigation, and concluding once again that there is a competition problem, is of little value if a suitable remedy cannot be found. A break-up of the Big Four is perceived by many as a necessary and long-awaited intervention, but is it the right solution? And if not, what would be an alternative remedy?\nThe previous investigation by the UK Competition Commission (CC), predecessor to the CMA, put forward a package of seven remedies, the most significant of which was a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit out to tender at least every ten years (\u2018mandatory tendering\u2019). Shortly thereafter, the EU introduced rules that obliged listed companies to switch their auditor (\u2018mandatory rotation\u2019) every 20 years. At the conclusion of the previous market investigation the CC expressed confidence in its package of remedies, noting that they should \u2018increase choice\u2019 and provide a \u2018substantially improved environment for competition\u2019. The CC\u2019s remedies package did not include any structural remedies.\nWhat could structural remedies achieve?\nHorizontal separation of the Big Four firms would immediately improve choice in the sense of seeing more than four firms in the market, and also choice in terms of seeing several non-conflicted audit firms in every audit tender. Such a separation would therefore also, in general terms, improve competition. It could also serve audit quality by reducing the number of instances where a company involved in a complex transaction cannot realistically find an adviser that is not subject to some conflict of interest.\nIn the case of Carillion, PwC acted as the company\u2019s pensions consultant (2002\u201317), then switched to advising the pension scheme trustees on Carillion\u2019s restructuring proposals (from July 2017), and was finally appointed by the government to help manage the defunct Carillion after its collapse (from January 2018). It would appear that PwC was the only viable choice to advise on Carillion\u2019s insolvency, because it was the only Big Four firm that did not have active contracts with Carillion at the time of Carillion\u2019s demise. Expanding the market from a \u2018Big Four\u2019 to a \u2018Large 6\u2019 seems attractive in the face of such apparent conflicts, but realistically it would be a very difficult exercise if the aim is to create a \u2018Large 6\u2019 group of firms of similar size with similar international networks.\nWould a break-up increase audit quality?\nAudits are for the protection of investors against false accounting by a company\u2019s management. The starting point is therefore that the true customer of audit, the investor, is not the procurer of audit services. This alone creates an environment in which market failures may be expected.\nBut why does audit quality fall short? Boeing and Airbus, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and the Silicon Valley giants all operate in concentrated markets\u2014but it seems highly unlikely that half of new aeroplanes, or soft drinks cans, possess substantial errors. Market concentration per se does not entail a poor-quality product: even a monopolist will have regard to product quality, knowing that if its product is faulty the financial consequences of fines and compensating consumers will typically be severe.\nIn equilibrium, a firm would only produce faulty items to the extent that it is rational to do so\u2014i.e. if errors cannot be detected or if the financial consequences of errors are insubstantial. It seems to be widely accepted that audit quality is below the level demanded by investors, on whose behalf the audit is undertaken. The economics literature on audit has studied the link between greater market concentration and higher audit fees, but this does not help us very much in the present circumstances, where the primary concerns are not to do with high prices, or even exclusionary conduct, but with limited choice and sub-optimal quality. Where does the solution lie?\nAre audit fines providing optimal enforcement?\nFrom an economics perspective, if the deterrence effect of penalties is sufficiently severe, firms that might otherwise chase market share by cutting prices and their costs for a given audit will be deterred from cutting quality. In other words, when deterrence is weak, there is an opportunity for rent-seeking by firms that cut quality on unobservable dimensions. Although it might be argued that the cost to an accountant\u2019s reputation is great enough to give the right incentives, this point seems difficult to sustain in light of the continued flourishing of firms that have had quite major hits to their professional reputations.\nEuropean Commission cartel fines are set based on the gravity and the duration of a competition infringement, and are capped at a maximum of 10% of a company\u2019s total turnover. The 10% turnover ceiling for fines is engaged only when a cartel fine based on the usual criteria would otherwise be set at more than 10% of turnover.\nCartel fines are large compared with audit fines, as Tables 1 and 2 illustrate. Looking at FRC audit fines in the cases mentioned above, the average fine is 0.016% of a Big Four firm\u2019s annual global turnover, as shown in Table 1. The final column of Table 1 indicates that increasing this percentage to 0.5% would lead to fines of a much greater order of magnitude. This is purely illustrative; it is not a recommendation as to the optimal size of audit fines.\nSource: FRC and the audit firms\u2019 annual reports for fiscal year 2017.\nSource: European Commission cartel statistics, last updated 21 March 2018.\nIt might be argued that increased deterrence for poor audit would come at the cost of competition, such as financial penalties leading to market exit and a \u2018Big Three\u2019, or hiking the barriers to entry for non-Big Four audit firms. Likewise, the Commission does not wish to fine a cartel with penalties that are so high that the consequence would be a reduction in the number of market competitors (or else the competition remedy would be self-defeating). Hence the scaling of cartel fines to turnover, and the \u2018inability to pay\u2019 test, whereby the Commission can reduce the scale of fines where it is shown that they pose a serious threat to the economic viability of the undertaking concerned. Scaling audit fines to audit firm turnover makes it unlikely that such penalties would deter entry or cause the market exit of one of the Big Four. The cartel fines policy therefore has useful principles, albeit it does not indicate the right order of magnitude for audit fines.\nSimilar research would be required to understand the effects of a different penalty regime for poor audit.\nThere is little doubt that a new CMA investigation would consider a break-up remedy. However, no matter what the divestments and structural changes, the inherent tension within the industry\u2019s \u2018client pays\u2019 business model is likely to remain\u2014that is, an auditor\u2019s basic conflict between serving the paying client and serving the greater good.\nIf it were to address that conflict, the CMA would need to look into penalties and deterrence, as well as studying the effects of a break-up remedy. It is not realistic to expect the CMA to be able to fix every major issue in the market by achieving the goal of reduced concentration in FTSE 350 audit.\nThe quality of audit might be improved with a more disaggregated market, but this link is not certain. Moreover, it is possible that greater deterrence for bad audit would lead to an organic change in market structure: the Big Four have expertise in advising clients as to when a substantial divestment or restructuring might increase shareholder value. It seems possible that, in a world of greater deterrence, the accounting firms might look inwards using this expertise and shake up the market structure themselves.\nFinally, the example of cartel fines shows that they are of a different scale to audit fines, raising the question as to whether fines should be reconsidered in the audit market. Penalties for anticompetitive conduct are used for prevention, not retribution. An audit firm with consistent high quality would have a minimal incidence of fines, which would place the high-quality firm at a competitive advantage to an audit firm with lower quality. If audit quality became high across the market, no firm would be faced with very substantial financial penalties, and investor perceptions as to the value of statutory audit might be restored. In summary: prevention is better than cure.\n Peter Kyle, Member of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, speaking at the pre-appointment hearing with the Government\u2019s preferred candidate for Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, HC 985, 24 April 2018.

{"prompt": "", "completion": "The bantamweight champion of DEEP, Takafumi Otsuka, will take on Koichi Ishiuzka on May 13th at Differ Ariake in Tokyo.\nOtsuka was supposed to fight Fernando Vieira for the WSOF-GC bantamweight title in December. However, the Brazilian was over the weight at the first weigh-in and never showed up at the second weigh-in. Vieira was nowhere to be found after this.The Brazilian basically fled from the entire show.\nOtsuka became the inaugural WSOF-GC champ but this means, the last time he fought was back in August of last year. That was, however, against a Mongolian fighter named Baataryn Azjavkhlan who was 1-0 at the time.\nIn terms of competitive fight, vs Daisuke Engo in February 2016 maybe is the last time Otsuka went through, which is more than a year ago.\nIshizuka is basically born and raised in DEEP.\nAnd, he is undefeated in the last ten fights.\nFor Ishizuka, this must be the opportunity he has been looking for all of his pro MMA career.\nSo, Ishizuka has to be motivated than ever.\nThe only concern is, his recent changes in the training environment. In last year, Ishizuka moved to Aichi because of the job which forced him to leave team Brightness Monma. And, Ishizuka joined team ALIVE which is based in Aichi prefecture.\nBesides this title fight between Otsuka and Ishizuka, men\u2019s strawweight bout between Haruo Ochi and \u201cRambo\u201d Kosuke is also confirmed.\nThese two met all the way back in May of 2011.\nThis fight took place in Shooto.\n\u201cRambo\u201d almost caught Ochi with an armbar in the first round. But Ochi came back and KO\u2019d Kosuke in the second round. That was \u201cRambo\u201d\u2018s first pro defeat in seven fights."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Arguably Inferior Socket for Paladin PvE Gems for the most part, but Superior for PvP.A side-grade to t6, but an upgrade for almost anything pre-Sunwell.\nThis item, and all the other engineering helm upgrades, are sunwell trash drops.\nSo since people need to start farming the instance to begin with and there will be people in the raids who need it you probably won't see this on the AH for quite some time depending on the server.\nI wouldn't call this a side grade at all, considering that Sunwell requires paladins to spam Holy Light a lot more than Flash of Light, making their mana regen come mostly from Illumination/holy crit (great for pallies with the 2 piece t6 crit bonus to HL) and being in a group with a Shadow Priest. The upgrades here are where it matters most - a 20 crit increase over t6 (more than 1 % - thats fantastic in a single piece!) and plus 9 healing. Armor? lol - what are you going to do, tank in holy gear in Sunwell? You'll need the stam for the boss fights consdering the dots that Kalecgos does, for starters. Int doesnt matter so much since your mana regen and your +heal are really the major factors in post BT/MH content.\nMy server has pug groups for sunwell trush run. BoP/BoE recipes usually drops from 1 to 5 and lots of epic-stones. You do not have to wear BT/Hyjal geared, Kara/SSC/TK gears are fine for trush run.\nIt usually goes 4k-5k on my server. It is a good resource of money, and you can call ppl when your guild does not have scheduled raid. However, you will need 5-6 mages for trush run.\nDropped for me tonight on Garithos-US on the last pull before the first stairs in the instance.\nMy guild's been running Sunwell since 2.4 release and the patterns are extremely rare. We've only had 4 patterns drop, ever, and two of them were the Sunfire Robe (both dropped the day before this Schematic).\nI was seriously beginning to believe I'd never get my hands on this because of its extreme rarity. I'm reasonably certain it's the only Sunwell Schematic to have dropped on my server as of yet. I've been passing on T6 helms for months in hopes of getting this and was going to give in and pick one up this week, then this baby swooped in!\nCan only be learned by Paladins.\nCan I learn this Schematic as a Rogue ?\nYou can only learn this on a pally and it's supposed to only drop for pallies, but it dropped for my DK today (maybe since there were no DKs when Sunwell was released?) My engineer is a druid and cannot use it but I hope some Paladin buys it as the sell price looks pretty high."}
