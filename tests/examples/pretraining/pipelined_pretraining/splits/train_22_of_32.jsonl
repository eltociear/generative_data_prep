{"prompt": "", "completion": "College or work? Gap year or victory lap? And how should a young person choose among the multitude of programs offered through universities, colleges or a combination of both?\nThose are just some of the questions faced by today\u2019s high school graduates.\nIn an era of tough competition for jobs, the rise of precarious employment and the disappearance of a linear path from school to work, teaching kids career and life planning is more important than ever.\nBut a new report from People for Education says Ontario students aren\u2019t getting what they need from the province\u2019s careers strategy, introduced over a three-year period beginning in 2013.\nPrincipals surveyed by the research and advocacy group cited problems implementing the plan, a shortage of guidance counsellors and lack of teacher training to help students at all levels.\nSo helping them understand themselves and their interests even as young students is key to making sure they have the tools to navigate a complex path.\nThe Ontario strategy includes such mandatory components as: portfolios for every student from kindergarten to Grade 12 to help them reflect on their interests, strengths, learning and later career possibilities; career and life-planning committees in every school; and professional development for teachers to help them integrate career and life planning into the classroom.\nIt is also linked to the existing 40 hours of mandatory community volunteering for high school students and the compulsory Grade 10 careers course.\nMandatory career and life-planning committees were in place in only 15 per cent of elementary schools and 39 per cent of high schools. And of those, only 8 per cent of secondary schools included community members.\nThirty-four per cent of elementary and 56 per cent of secondary schools reported that every student had a career/life-planning portfolio.\nTeacher training on career and life planning was available at fewer than one in four elementary schools and 40 per cent of high schools.\nWhile high school guidance counsellors are the primary staff members responsible for student portfolios and planning, 16 per cent of secondary schools don\u2019t have a full-time guidance counsellor.\nThe average ratio is one counsellor for every 380 students \u2014 in line with what provincial funding provides \u2014 but one in 10 schools struggles with a ratio of 600 students per teacher.\nPrincipals said two years of education labour disputes interfered with the new strategy, but also blamed lack of technology support, workload issues, and a lack of overall understanding of the policy.\n\u201cWhile lots of them talked about how great the policy was, an equal number talked about how difficult it was to implement,\u201d says Kidder.\nShe cited \u201cinitiative exhaustion\u201d among teachers and administrators following a stream of new education strategies ranging from math to well-being to experiential learning, which can leave staff overwhelmed. And she called for better integration of the career and life lessons with all school subjects.\nFor Bruce Lawson of the Counselling Foundation of Canada, making the most of the provincial strategy is key. And he says despite the challenges addressed in the report, it is one of the best in the country.\nBy the time today\u2019s elementary students graduate, at least one third of the occupations open to them will be jobs that don\u2019t currently exist, says Lawson, president of the foundation, which promotes career planning and development. For kindergarten students, it amounts to more than half.\nOur editors found this article on this site using Google and regenerated it for our readers."}

He\u2019s still pursuing appeals, which no one expects to go anywhere.\nGreene is a maximum security prison, classified as a \u201cSupermax\u201c, which contains a Death Row. Lifers there include Philadelphia serial killer Juan Covington, and three convicts await execution. This is one tough place.\nJust how effective will the security measures be? Better be Biohazard Level 5 containment for Ol\u2019 Jer.\nHe will not have a cellmate and will be subjected to heightened supervision and an escort when not in his cell. He will get an hour of individual exercise five days a week and three showers a week \u2014 alone, save for the escort. He will eat meals in his cell. All other services, including religion, medications, and treatment programming will be conducted in his cell.\nAll visits will be non-contact. No touching of or by the Tickle Monster.\nSandusky\u2019s legal representations did not return phone calls.\nThis is close to home for \u201cJer\u201d. His home town of \u201cLittle Washington\u201d is a half-hour north on I-79. A further half-hour north lies the thriving, post-ferrous metropolis of Pittsburgh.\nThe State Correctional Institution at Greene, as it is formally known, is a maximum-security prison that houses a total of 1,800 inmates and employs 700 people."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "CG Cosmetic understands the difficulties that come with aging. Everyone has days where they look in the mirror and are concerned with what they see. Whether or not you see deep lines and wrinkles, or fine lines, aging is inevitable. The question then, is what can you do about these signs of aging? Perhaps the most common solution people have heard of is Botox. However, Botox is not the only option. While CG Cosmetic offers Botox procedures, we also offer Dermal Fillers.\nMost men and women have heard about celebrities using Botox to rejuvenate their skin and appear more youthful, but Botox isn\u2019t just for celebrities. Botox has provided amazing and effective results that are also safe and convenient for many individuals. Facial lines and wrinkles often occur because of the way your muscles work underneath your skin. Overtime, as muscles tense due to making repeated facial expressions, your skin creates lines and wrinkles. Botox works by gently relaxing the muscles in your face, softening the wrinkles and leaving you with long-lasting smooth skin. CG Cosmetic patients have described their Botox experience as quick and painless, with most appointments taking less than one hour. Call to set up an appointment with our expert Botox specialist, Dr. Mayra Diaz, who has been in private practice for over 25 years.\nCG Cosmetic also specializes in Dermal Fillers. Different from Botox, dermal fillers work by lifting and plumping up skin, replacing collagen lost by the natural aging process. In addition to gently filling the skin, most dermal fillers also stimulate skin to encourage it to produce more collagen on its own. Dermal fillers are a great way to fix lines and wrinkles in the face, but they are also used for lip augmentations, creating fuller, plumper lips.\nIt is important to fully research all of your options for cosmetic surgery before making a decision about what is right for you. Start your research with a call to CG Cosmetic and talk to a specialist by scheduling a free consultation: 305-446-7277."}
