Susy even put up a Facebook page where all info, photos and videos in relation to the search was posted.\nFinally after weeks of anticipation, Susy and Geno reunited again where the two met up not only with each other but with their loyal and very enthusiastic supporters, waving banners and placards expressing their unwavering support.\nGeno arrived at the activity center holding a fresh bouquet for Susy. It was a wonderful day for Susy and Geno and for their solid fans club. After long years of waiting, the two best friends shared a long and warm embrace.\nCheck out this YouTube video dance performance from Susy and Geno!\nThe two gladly gave a dance number people requested for. Afterwards, the pair mingled with the crowd where the latter grab the chance to take photos with them.\nThe reunion was also the first public appearance in many years for the faces of Sustagen Milk in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, who disappeared from the public eye, only to re-emerge two decades later, starting with Susy\u2019s return last February. Only then would we find out that she and Geno had actually lost touch through the years.\nMeanwhile, Susy and Geno\u2019s friends from Sustagen also did their part, providing free milk for all guests and fans.\nIt was a lovely day for Susy and Geno and for their loyal supporters. I\u2019m sure happy memories came to you as you watched them reunited."}

Tonight Amy came over to try my second attempt at the Brussels Sprouts Veggie Soup to which I have made some changes (see recipe below in previous post) for a better result, I believe.\nWe were at the store earlier and saw some nice looking haricot verts and heirloom tomatoes, so we decide to assemble a simple salad from those. Of course while I\u2019m at the market, I can\u2019t not get some five peppercorn salami. Our simple dinner of soup, salami, bread, cheese, salad, and wine was on the table in 15 minutes."}
