This day signifies the appearance of Lord Narasimha on the planet. Lord Narasimha is the fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is believed to have appeared to protect his devotee, Prahlada, from his father Hiranyakashyapu . If you listen to the song ” Narashima Nembo davana” posted on youtube, there is a paragraph which explains how Lord Narashima came from the pillar. Hiranyakashyapu pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Lord Vishnu was present in it pillar. Prahalada who was a great devotee said yes. Next, you know Hiranyakashyapu uses his Gadha and broke open the pillar and there emerged our Lord Narasimha who than slained Hiranyakashyapu using his sharp paws. The day signifies the triumph of good over evil and the eagerness of the lord to protect his devotees from evil. When my Parents visited us last year, my Father recited the “Bhagavatha Purana” for three weeks at my place. The way my Dad explained this part of the Purana, brings tears to my eyes every time I listen “Narashima Nembo Devana”. The greatest mistake I made was to not record the purana. Hopefully will record the next time my Father visits us. About Narasimha Jayanthi: Ms. Lakshmi’s write up summary from the book “ಭಾರತೀಯ ಹಬ್ಬ ಹರಿದಿನಗಳು” by ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀ ರಂಗಪ್ರಿಯ ಮಹಾದೇಷಿಕ ಸ್ವಾಮಿಗಳು.

Probably the only SPOT where you can get to the slopes in less then 15 minutes. Sadly this year K.O.T. Gruam was boycotted by bad weather, misunderstanding and lack of snow. But still some warriors showed up for chilling and grilling under the Dragon tent (thank you Dragon so much for keeping us dry).
