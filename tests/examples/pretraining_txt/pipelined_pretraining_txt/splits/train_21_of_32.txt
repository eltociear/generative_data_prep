On the other hand if you are starting beekeeping and would like to begin professional beekeeping today download a copy of our beekeeping for beginners ebook. Beekeeping can be a full-time profession or a hobby that is simple. Nonetheless, more often than not, what started as a hobby would turn into a profession. But you cannot simply tell and decide yourself you will start to do beekeeping. Before starting on any avocation or profession, you need to have understanding and satisfactory knowledge on the subject that you are going to enter. If you’ve been putting off your interest in beekeeping for quite a while, then it’s about time to indulge yourself in your line of interest. Bee farming may seem simple; learning the basic beekeeping lessons can enable you to get away to a good start. What does a beekeeper need to understand? On beekeeping to start at the right foot you should have interest that is complete. You need to spend time taking care of your colonies of bees. You should have also agreed to share your home space with the bees. There are potential risks in beekeeping that can harm not only you but your family also. Your focus is not only to make money by selling honey; a good beekeeper should have passion and a keen interest in rearing bees. An apiarist should know the right place for the beehives. You have to make sure beekeeping is allowed in your area, if you decide to place your beehives at your backyard. There are several places restricted to beekeeping; you have to get permission concerning this. Beekeepers must know whether beekeeping supplies are available in the area where the beehives are situated. When you must go to a neighborhood beekeeping shop you may never understand; it is best that a nearby beekeeping store is reachable. Equipment and protective tools are also very important to beekeepers to know. Know the right kind of suit to choose to keep you from any possible danger in beekeeping. If you’re incapable to harvest honey from your bees all the efforts that are beekeeping would be futile. A beekeeper should know the methods in gathering the honey from the comb; beeswax is also part of the returns in beekeeping.
In her firstbook Stay Hungry Stay Foolish Rashmi Bansal profiled twenty five entrepreneurs who were alumni of IIM – Ahmedabad. Many had then wondered including yours truly, how important an MBA degree is to become an entrepreneur. Rashmi claims this inspired her to write Connect The Dots, story of twenty one entrepreneurs but who dont have an MBA degree. The format of the book is same as her last book. There are twenty chapters, one on each entrepreneur (Gaurav Rathore & Saurabh Vyas who co founded PoliticalEDGE are covered in one chapter) and the entire chapter is based on one single interview. The book is divided in three sections : Jugaad, Junoon & Zubaan. Jugaadis are those who didn’t get any formal training in business but learned by observing, experimenting and applying their mind. It includes some one like Kunwer Sachdev of Su-Kam who created a Rs 500 crore company from scratch; Ganesh Ram, who started what is today India’s largest English training academy, VETA when there were no BPOs and no one knew that English coaching would be as big a market as it is now. Junoonis as the name suggests, are passionate about something that is ahead of its time. This was my favorite section in the book. Gaurav Rathore and Saurabh Vyas envisioned a consulting and research firm exclusively for politics and founded PoliticalEDGE; Satyajit Singh, founder of Shakti Sudha not only created a new industry but also benefited thousands of farmers in rural Bihar; Chetan Maini, founder of Reva, designed a solar car and has been producing electric cars since the time when global warming was not so well known and creating electric cars seemed to make little sense. The third section Zubaan is about creative people like Paresh Mokashi, creator of Harishchandrachi Factory, India’s official entry to Oscar last year or Krishna Reddy, whose Prince Dance Group, consisting of daily wage laborers won India’s Got Talent last year. I had great hopes from the book as I loved Stay Hungry Stay Foolish. The first chapter on Prem Ganpathy is literally a rags to riches story of someone who came to Mumbai with no money and now owns Dosa Plaza, a fast food chain with 26 outlets in the country.The rest of the stories too are very encouraging. The book is replete with inspiring anecdotes and quotes . When I read the synopsis on the third section i.e. Zubaan, I thought it would be probably the weak link in this book as stories on creatives who had made it big in the field of art would be a misfit in this book about entrepreneurs. However, all these artists achieved commercial success by following their passion and this justifies their inclusion in this book about Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship after all is about following your heart. Generally when the first book is good and successful authors fail to recreate the magic in their subsequent books and that too in the same genre, as people have high expectations. In this case Rashmi Bansal definitely exceeded my expectations. A very good book and must read for some one aspires to be an entrepreneur.
