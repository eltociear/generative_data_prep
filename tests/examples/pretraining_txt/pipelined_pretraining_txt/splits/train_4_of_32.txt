How can I teach my toddler to do things independently? You’ve probably become more patient since you started this whole parenthood thing. And you’re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent. For example, she tells you she can’t finish the puzzle she’s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you’re going to have to tell her you’ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she’s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time. Remember that children each progress at their own rate. It’s not always fast — and there will be setbacks along the way. But the more you can allow them to do on their own without stepping in, the more they’ll be likely to try for themselves again and again.

I do love spending time in my studio that has become a haven for creating my upcycled bags. I’m adding new bags as quick as I get them done to my Etsy shop. Take a look…it’s called itzaChicThing. I love to layer color, pattern and texture. I created this bag using a fusing process. After making many bags, all shapes and sizes (you can see some of them at bohochicbag.com), I decided to use the same concept to create pieces for hanging.
