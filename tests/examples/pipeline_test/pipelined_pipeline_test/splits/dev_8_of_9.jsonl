{"prompt": "TEXT: The European stonechat was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Motacilla rubicola.[2] This species is now placed in the genus Saxicola that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthus Bechstein in 1802.[3][4] The English name derives from its call, sounding like two stones knocked together. The scientific name Saxicola means \"rock-dweller\", from Latin saxum meaning \"a rock\" and incola meaning \"dwelling in\". The specific epithet combines the Latin rubus meaning \"brambles\" with incola.[5] The subspecies name hibernans refers to Ireland (Latin, Hibernia). QUERY: Given the subject 'European Stonechat' and object 'Saxicola', what's the relation between them? 'family name', 'instance of', 'parent taxon', 'after a work by' or 'located in the administrative territorial entity'?", "completion": " parent taxon"}
