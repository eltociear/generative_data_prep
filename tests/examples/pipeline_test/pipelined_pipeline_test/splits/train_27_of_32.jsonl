{"prompt": "TEXT: Peyton Manning may be keeping quiet about his future football plans, but not his dad. In an interview shortly after Peyton's Super Bowl win on Sunday, his father Archie toldNFL Network; 'I think Peyton's done in Denver. He may be done everywhere. I don't know that. But that's my guess.' He then added that he believes his son has made up his mind about whether or not to retire, but has yet to share his decision with the family. Peyton, who will turn 40 in March, would only say that he planned to 'reflect' on the future after his big win. If Peyton does decide to keep playing there is a chance he could return to the Broncos next season as he still has a year left on his contract. Reports have also emerged that the newly relocated St. Louis Rams are interested in signing the quarterback. Scroll down for video This has been a particularly difficult season for Manning, despite the fact that he capped it off with a Super Bowl victory. His play was uneven at the start of the season and in Week 10 he was benched by head coach Gary Kubiak after throwing four interceptions against Kansas City. It was announced the following day that he was suffering from plantar fasciitis and would not play the following week, leading many to speculate that he was soon to be replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler. He was back at starting quarterback by the end of the season however, and despite having the worst season of his 18-year career was able to get his second Super Bowl thanks in large part to the Broncos strong defense. Peyton was also asked to take a $4million pay cut by the Broncos at the beginning of the season, a loss he managed to recoup by collecting the $2million bonuses promised to him if the team won the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl. He is also the focus of an NFL investigation after a report emerged alleging he had used human growth hormones to recover from a 2012 neck injury, a banned substance in the league. Peyton said after Sunday's game he did not want to make a public announcement and take away from the team, though he did plug Budweiser in two of his post-game interviews leading some to speculate it was a sign he planned to retire.
