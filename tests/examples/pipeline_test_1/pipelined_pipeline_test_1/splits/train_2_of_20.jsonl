Passage: Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 \u2013 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.\nAs a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent.\nThrough his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.", "target": "What is the last name of the person who is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents.\nBruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists.", "target": "What is the full name of the person that was distrusted by the new regime?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Jack Griffith, known as \"Papa\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many. To impress his six-year-old daughter Corinne, he spends the family's savings to buy his own circus, simply so the little girl can have her own pony.\nHis elder daughter Augusta becomes distraught as her father makes some questionable business deals under the influence of alcohol.  This  causes strife within the Griffith household and makes her beau's father (the local bank president) forbid his son to associate with the Griffith family.\nAfter his squandering leaves the Griffiths in debt, wife Ambolyn packs up Augusta and Corinne and moves to Texarkana, Texas, where her father, Anthony Ghio, is the mayor. Griffith attempts to use his circus to help Ghio's bid for reelection, but accidentally causes Ambolyn to end up with a broken hand.\nDespondent, he leaves for Louisiana and is little seen or heard from by the family. Talked into an attempt at reconciliation, Papa is reluctant, believing the Griffiths want nothing more to do with him, but he is welcomed back with open arms.", "target": "What is the last name of the person who spends the family's savings to buy his own circus?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" debuted to mixed and positive reviews among critics. Mike Joseph of the international webzine PopMatters' believed that it was \"fantastic to hear Beyonc\u00e9 singing her lungs out over a full-bodied groove featuring live instruments\". Spence D. of IGN Music, a multimedia news and reviews website, complimented Jerkins' bass-laden groove, writing that it brought the track to perfection. Describing \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" as a magnificent song, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian complimented Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z collaboration calling it \"feverish as pre-watershed pop gets\". She added that even though when Jay-Z is not physically present, he manages to bring out something formidable in Beyonc\u00e9 that evokes \"the young, feral Tina Turner\". Bernard Zuel The Sydney Morning Herald praised the assertiveness with which Beyonc\u00e9 delivers her lines and considered buying \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" as worthwhile.Several other music critics have compared \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" to Beyonc\u00e9's 2003 single, \"Crazy in Love\", the lead single of her debut album. According to Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine, the song is viewed by many as a sequel to \"Crazy in Love\". Jason King of the Vibe magazine deemed the song as \"cloned from the DNA of the raucous 'Crazy in Love'\" while Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine referred to it as \"'Crazy in Love' lite\". Some reviewers, however, were negative to the parallels drawn between the two songs. Andy Kellman of AllMusic, an online music database, wrote that \"['D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'] \"had the audacity to not be as monstrous as 'Crazy in Love'\", referring to the commercial success the latter experienced in 2003. The internet-based publication Pitchfork's writer Ryan Dombal claimed that \"this time [Beyonc\u00e9] out-bolds the beat\".Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker deemed the lyrics as a \"perplexing view of memory\", while Chris Richards of The Washington Post characterized Beyonc\u00e9 as a \"love-dazed girlfriend\" in the song. Jody Rosen of the Entertainment Weekly referred to \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" as an \"oddly flat\" choice as a lead single. Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music regarded \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" as a good choice for a single but concluded that it does lack \"the kind of killer chorus\" to suggest that Beyonc\u00e9 would take one further step \"to outright global domination\". On the other hand, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that Jay-Z shows up \"as calmly boastful as ever\" in the song but he only makes Beyonc\u00e9's \"sound more insecure\". Kelefa Sanneh of the same publication noted that \"the refrain doesn't give Beyonc\u00e9 a chance really to show off\" and further described the song as a \"fair-to-middling single from a singer who is the opposite of desperate\".", "target": "What is the name of the two songs that many music critics compare?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.", "target": "What is the first name of the person who called John Dalton as a replacement?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: North Sister, also known as \"Faith\", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is 5 miles (8 km) wide, and its summit elevation is 10,090 feet (3,075 m). Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene.North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a 980-foot (300 m)-wide volcanic plug. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion.   At one point, the volcano stood more than 11,000 feet (3,400 m) high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn.", "target": "What is the alias of the volcano that has deposits rich in palagonite?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Belarus is a presidential republic, governed by a president and the National Assembly. The term for each presidency is five years. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could serve for only two terms as president, but a change in the constitution in 2004 eliminated term limits. Alexander Lukashenko has been the president of Belarus since 1994. In 1996, Lukashenko called for a controversial vote to extend the presidential term from five to seven years, and as a result the election that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. The referendum on the extension was denounced as a \"fantastic\" fake by the chief electoral officer, Viktar Hanchar, who was removed from the office for official matters only during the campaign. The National Assembly is a bicameral parliament comprising the 110-member House of Representatives (the lower house) and the 64-member Council of the Republic (the upper house).\nThe House of Representatives has the power to appoint the prime minister, make constitutional amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and specialized courts such as the Constitutional Court, which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.In the 2012 parliamentary election, 105 of the 110 members elected to the House of Representatives were not affiliated with any political party. The Communist Party of Belarus won 3 seats, and the Agrarian Party and Republican Party of Labour and Justice, one each. Most non-partisans represent a wide scope of social organizations such as workers' collectives, public associations, and civil society organizations, similar to the composition of the Soviet legislature.", "target": "What party in the country that is a presidential republic won 3 seats in the 2012 parliamentary election?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24 days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02 am, marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168 seconds of silence \u2013 one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.Vice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that \"goodness overcame evil\". The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City.President George W. Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: \"For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on.\" Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield, Illinois, to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.
