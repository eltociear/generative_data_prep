Passage: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986.", "target": "What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\". He returned to England in June 1919.", "target": "What is the full name of the person who the YMCA is reportedly sending to Salonica quite soon?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Radiohead fused together parts from three different songs, each written by a different member of the band. The idea to combine the pieces into a single track was inspired in part by the through-composed structure of The Beatles' \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\".\n\"Basically an excuse to weld loads of half-finished songs together, Abbey Road-style. It's Radiohead, pissed and having a party. I wasn't there when it was all stuck together \u2013 I'd been sent to sleep it off. What's it all about? The fall of the Roman Empire.\" \u2013 Thom YorkeColin Greenwood admitted that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, \"felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this ... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous\". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title \"was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would like me to be. And that was the end of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all.\" In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it \"just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together\". The band used Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and the work of Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote \"a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties\", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.\"Paranoid Android\" was recorded in actress Jane Seymour's 15th-century mansion near the village of St Catherine, near Bath, Somerset. The first edit was over 14 minutes long and included a long organ interlude performed by Jonny Greenwood. Radiohead played this extended version during a tour with Alanis Morissette in September 1996. \"When we started playing it live, it was completely hilarious,\" recalled O'Brien. \"There was a rave down section and a Hammond organ outro, and we'd be pissing ourselves while we played. We'd bring out the glockenspiel and it would be really, really funny.\" Before the song's first live performance, Yorke told audiences that \"[i]f you can have sex to this one, you're fucking weird.\" He also sarcastically referred to the version of the song played during the tour as \"a Pink Floyd cover\".Inspired by the editing of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour (described by Colin Greenwood as \"brutal\"), Radiohead shortened the song to a final six and a half minutes, a process that led to Jonny Greenwood's organ section being replaced by a substantially shorter guitar fade out. However, it took the band a year and a half to learn how to play the final version in live performance.", "target": "What is the name of the song that was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from a character in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

A newly-bought slave was welcomed with nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part in most of the civic and family cults; they were expressly invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves. Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the battle of Marathon, and the monuments memorialize them. It was formally decreed before the battle of Salamis that the citizens should \"save themselves, their women, children, and slaves\".Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships (\"A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.\"), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae (\"A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.\"). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.\nThe sons of vanquished foes would be enslaved and often forced to work in male brothels, as in the case of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an enterprise by the philosopher's rich friends. On the other hand, it is attested in sources that the rape of slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.", "target": "What is the name of the man who put forth a law preventing slaves from engaging free boys in pederastic relationships?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: In 2011, a group of soldiers and a  journalist team head out to the jungles of Belize. The mission was thought to just be plant surveillance on hostile state borders. The soldiers and Julie Evans team locate an abandoned boat in the middle of an open field.  One of the soldiers advises Julie that the nearest ocean to where they found the boat is at least 150 miles. A camera with an intact SD card was retrieved from the boat. Footage from the SD card contained underwater footage and ended with a man screaming  as the screen fades to black.\nAfterwards, the team decides to make camp and set up security cameras. Night vision cameras show various animals roaming around. One of the cameras suddenly blacks out. At dawn, the soldiers find markings on trees near Julie's sleeping area. They soon discover that a camera - the one that blacked out earlier, was destroyed.\nThe group soon receives new orders from base. An archaeological team has gone missing. And they are to head to the area where Dr. Holden's archaeological team was last seen. They soon run into a man cutting wood and asks him about the missing archaeological team. He claims to have no idea where they are.\nThe group arrives at Dr. Holden's camp site. They only find a man who claims to also be looking for Dr. Holden. A video diary belonging to Dr. Holden is then shown. It's shown in the video that Dr. Holden located a mysterious skull inside the cave. Afterwards, a strange sound is heard and the camera woman Susan runs outside the cave panicking.\nJulie is then informed that one of the two missing archaeologist has been found and they head to the location. On their way they encounter a Mennonite community. The Mennonites then proceed to show them to where Susan is. Susan claims she knows where Holden is and will take them to where she last saw him. Susan explains that what attacked them was not human. It is then that they experience a strange trembling and Susan claims that it is the same thing that happened to them.", "target": "Who is filming the video diary in the cave?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

Passage: Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\" he wrote, adding: \"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \"what limits he puts on his own rights\". To this Shackleton replied: \"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170\u00b0 W\u2014everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land. Polar historian Beau Riffenburgh believes this was \"a promise that should never ethically have been demanded and one that should never have been given, impacting as it might on the entire safety of Shackleton's expedition\". The dispute soured relations between the two men (who nevertheless maintained public civilities), and would eventually lead to the complete rupture of Shackleton's formerly close friendship with Wilson.In his own account of the expedition Shackleton makes no reference to the wrangle with Scott. He merely states that \"before we finally left England I had decided that if possible I would establish my base in King Edward VII Land instead of [...] McMurdo Sound\".", "target": "What is the name of the person who wrote, \"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work\"?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}

This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100\u2013200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\"Grandfather Vulture\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \"big chief\" who \"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\" according to Miguel Orrego.

Passage: The white-naped xenopsaris (Xenopsaris albinucha), also known as the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, the only member of the genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid subtropical and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae.\nThe bird is 12.5 to 13 cm (4.9\u20135.1 in) in length, with whitish undersides, a black crown, and grey-brown upperparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the females have duller upperparts. It feeds on insects in the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes on the ground. Nesting occurs in a simple cup nest placed in the fork of a tree. Both parents incubate the eggs and help feed the chicks. When the chicks fledge, the parents may divide up the brood to continue helping. The species is not common and little is known about it, but it is not considered in danger of extinction, and has been classified as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.", "target": "What are the common names of the animal that is mostly sedentary?", "dataset": "natural-instructions", "task": "task001_quoref_question_generation.json", "category": ["Question Generation"]}
