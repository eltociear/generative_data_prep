{"prompt": "Review text:\nOkay, I am not sure what has possessed me to return to this place after my first experience there.  The only thing that I can think of is that the passage of time dulled my senses and made me forget about my prior experiences, but I have written myself a note reminding myself to avoid this place in the future. \\n\\nThis restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only \\\"nice\\\" places downtown, but luckily that has changed.  I went there for dinner one night and because I did not feel like ordering a $20 salad, I decided to order a $15 sandwich.  THe only thing that I can think of is that upon hearing my order the \\\"chef\\\" immediately ran down to the nearest vending machine and got a roast beef sandwich out of that vending machine, took the sandwich out of the plastic wrap and plopped it down on the plate and actually had the gonads to serve it as if they made it!  It was by far the worst meal I have had in some time and is a constant reminder why I will not eat there again, unless my Alzheimers kicks in.  \\n\\nIf you have to go there my recommendation is that you eat before hand and simply order a martini.\\n\\nikk8ide 2ccccccc.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5): ", "completion": "\n1"}
