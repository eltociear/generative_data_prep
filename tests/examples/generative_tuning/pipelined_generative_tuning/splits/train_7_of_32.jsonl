{"prompt": "Review text:\nThe club itself is amaaazing - if you can get inside, that is. Anytime I've been with a group of girls, it's been super easy to just breeze in. But if you're with a guy - forget it.\\n\\nThe dance floor is super air-conditioned...something that no other club in Vegas has caught on to, it seems. The outdoor area by the pool is really pretty and also great for cooling off (or hiding from freaks on the dance floor).\\n\\nThe only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is b/c of the door guys. They're total douchebags and assholes. Worse than any of the other nightclubs in Vegas. Thank God I've never been on the receiving end of their bullshit \\\"discretion\\\" but I've seen them throw guys out of the line simply b/c they complained amongst themselves about how they've been waiting for 3 hours and its their birthday, and have seen countless people go inside before them b/c they tipped the door guys. I mean, ultimately you should just follow their example and tip them too if you really want to get in that bad but its unnecessary to throw people out just for speaking the truth out loud. Come on...that seems a little Commie-like, no?\\n\\nAnyway, despite the guido security (all-white suits + really really orange skin + top 3 buttons undone + chest hair poking out + gold chains....UGH), I really like Tryst and try to come back every time I'm in Sin City.\n\nStars: ", "completion": "\n3 stars"}
