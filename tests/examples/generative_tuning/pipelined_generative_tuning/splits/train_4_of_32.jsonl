{"prompt": "I glanced over all these rave reviews and I'm sorry I get lazy to go into detail bc it seems so redundant!  So, here's another gushing review of this place, I'll try and keep it short!\\nCame here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and..\\nIt's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  \\nLove the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables?\\nMy favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread.\\nThe foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy! \\nCan't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?\nSo I would like to give it ", "completion": " 5 stars"}
{"prompt": "Review text:\nThis place is a little off the beaten path, but it's always the hidden gems that deliver the most delicious dishes. There were so many choices on the menu, my head was spinning. So my husband and I decided to go with the pit special so we could try as many meats and sides as possible. I'm just going to say you can't go wrong with any of the BBQ fare. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, hot links- all amazing! The hot links were nice and spicy and all the other meat was super tender and delectable. \\nThe beans were a great side- thick and chunky with big pieces of pork mixed throughout. Yum yum. The potato salad had crispy pieces of bacon on top which launched it into a new level of awesome-ness. The fried okra was perfectly breaded and fried. No extra salt required. The mac and cheese just seemed like a dud next to all the other sides, so I'd skip that one if possible.\\nAs for the dessert- the peach cobbler was too much peach and not enough cobbler. You could tell that they used a canned peach to make it and it was just not doing it for me. The peach cobbler wasn't the best, but maybe i'll try the banana pudding next time.\n\nStars: ", "completion": "\n4 stars"}
{"prompt": "Eh, this place was cool (haha no pun intended) but defintely not worth the crazy price you had to pay.  Honestly had we not had a coupon for this place, we wouldn't have gone.  The idea is really neat to make an entire bar out of ice, except that this place was just the size of a giant walk in meat locker with a tiny little bar.  Also, when we went there were literallly 2 other people in the whole place, and at some point the bartender just walked out so I couldn't order another drink if I wanted to.  I guess they make enough money elsewhere  that doesn't matter, because you can't take your phone/camera in and they charge you stupid amounts to have your picture just like you would if you rode a rollercoaster at an amusement park. \\n\\nTip- DONT PAY FULL PRICE AT THIS PLACE!! there are coupons floating around everywhere and I'm pretty sure we got in using a buy one get one. ALSO the girls were handing out free shot coupons before we went in.  Definitely take advantage of this!\\n\\nIt was an experience, not sure I'd go back... unless for something crazy like a bachellorette bikini party in the ice bar (theres all sorts of pics of people doing/wearing crazy things in there).  Otherwise, take mine and most of the other reviewers' advice and know what you're getting into when you decide to come to this place.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is ", "completion": " 2 stars"}
