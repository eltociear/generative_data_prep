{"prompt": "Review text:\nSO, my first experience at Sandbar is as follows...I am out with my mom looking for a bite to eat for lunch...there are exactly 4 people in the entire place. It takes the hostess 15 min to seat us as she is so busy flaunting her A$$ in some servers direction who OBVIOUSLY is NOT interested as he keeps looking away and walking off in another direction....ok ok, so we finally get seated. It now takes our server 10 min to actually come over and take our drink order. Another 10 min to bring it back.It proceeds like this until we actually were begging for our check to pay and get the heck out...reminder there are only 4 people in the entire place... the food was awful, the drinks sucked hard, and the services was BOGUS....\\n\\n2nd experience.....AHWATUKEE COUGARS. Need I say more. Absolutely AWFUL...I wanted to bludgeon my eyes out and run screaming into the road. \\n\\nI feel sorry for the local 21 and up's trying to have fun getting humped by the cougars. EEEEWWWWWWW.....I will never go back.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5): ", "completion": "\n1"}
{"prompt": "Review text:\nNot the best Target I've seen..\\nDefinitely needs some fixing up or updating! Unorganized, empty on the shelves and I didn't see many employees walking around wanting to help people. Lots of beat up, broken boxes of the items they have! A lot of misplaced things everywhere! Also I noticed that the shelves are a little filthy, as in dusty and dirt-y! \\n\\nI like Target but this location just doesn't seem as nice as the others!\n\nReview rating: ", "completion": "\n3 stars"}
