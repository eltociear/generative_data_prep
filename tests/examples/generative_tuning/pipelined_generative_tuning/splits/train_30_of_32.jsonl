{"prompt": "Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A nomad scavenger treks through an irradiated wasteland and discovers a buried robot. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy, who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter, a former soldier, and Mo's friend Shades. When Alvy steps away, Mo buys the robot parts from the nomad and sells all but the head to Alvy. Intrigued by the technology, Alvy begins to research its background. Mo and Shades visit Jill, Mo's reclusive girlfriend, and, after an initially distant welcome where Jill checks them with a Geiger counter, Mo presents the robot head as a Christmas gift. Jill, a metal sculptor, eagerly accepts the head. After Shades leaves, Mo and Jill argue about a government sterilization plan and the morality of having children. Later, they have sex, while being unknowingly watched by their foul-mouthed, perverted, voyeuristic neighbor Lincoln Weinberg via telescope.\nJill works the robot head into a sculpture, and Mo says that he likes the work, but he does not understand what it represents. Frustrated, Jill says it represents nothing and resents Mo's suggestion that she make more commercial art to sell. They are interrupted by Alvy, who urges Mo to return to the shop, as he has important news about the robot, which he says is a M.A.R.K. 13. Before he leaves, Mo checks his Bible, where he finds the phrase \"No flesh shall be spared\" under Mark 13:20, and he becomes suspicious that the robot is part of a government plot for human genocide. Mo finds Alvy dead of a cytotoxin and evidence that the robot is an experimental combat model capable of self-repair; Alvy's notes also indicate a defect, a weakness to humidity. Worried, Mo contacts Shades and asks him to check on Jill, but Shades is in the middle of a drug trip and barely coherent.\nBack at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures and recharged by draining her apartment's power network.

{"prompt": "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: I've watched Millionaire Matchmaker and enjoy it entertainment value, and I appreciated Patti's straight-shooting approach. I got this video out of sure curiosity and to see if she had any tips. But oh wow- This was a joke. I agree with the reviewer who noted poor production quality and terrible scripting. My friends and I are planning a watch party for the sole purpose to make fun of it.I say it's a joke, but it's also insulting to single women and also single men. She insults the women who attend her conference, she insults the men who she talks to at the round table discussion.... it's just awkward. The disappointing thing, though, is that this isn't the person she is on her TV show.Save your money or buy it cheaply. Or do what I did and make it a watch party for you and your single friends.\nAnswer: ", "completion": "\nNo"}
