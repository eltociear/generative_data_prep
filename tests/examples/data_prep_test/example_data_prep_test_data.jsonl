{"prompt": "TEXT: This paper presents a new approach for contrast enhancement of spinal cord medical images based on multirate scheme incorporated into multiscale retinex algorithm. The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space separates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is achieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny, small, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each versions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in enormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching and MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each of the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by combining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite enhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using a wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using proposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise (Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed algorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord regions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions. Elaborated experiments are conducted on several medical images and results presented show that the enhanced medical pictures are of good quality and is found to be better compared with other researcher methods.

{"prompt": "TEXT: The exponential increase in digital data with online media, surveillance cameras among others, creates a growing need to develop intelligent models for complex spatio-temporal processing. Recent efforts in deep learning and computer vision have focused on building systems that learn and think like humans 1, 2 . Despite the biological inspiration and remarkable performance of such models, even beating humans in certain cognitive tasks 3 , the gap between humans and artificially engineered intelligent systems is still great. One important divide is the size of the required training datasets. Studies on mammalian concept understanding have shown that humans and animals can rapidly learn complex visual concepts from single training examples 4 . In contrast, the state-of-the-art intelligent models require vast quantities of labeled data with extensive, iterative training to learn suitably and yield high performance. While the proliferation of digital media has led to the availability of massive raw and unstructured data, it is often impractical and expensive to gather annotated training datasets for all of them. This motivates our work on learning to recognize from few labeled data. Specifically, we propose a reservoir based spiking neural model that reliably learns to recognize actions in video data by extracting long-range structure from a small number of training examples. Reservoir or Liquid Computing approaches have shown surprising success in recent years on a variety of temporal data based recognition problems (though effective vision applications are still scarce) [5] [6] [7] . This can be attributed to populations of recurrently connected spiking neurons, similar to the mammalian neocortex anatomy 8 , which create a high-dimensional dynamic representation of an input stream. The advantage with such an approach is that the reservoir (with sparse/random internal connectivity) implicitly encodes the temporal information in the input and provides a unique non-linear description for each input sequence, that can be trained for read out by a set of linear output neurons. In fact, in our view, the non-linear integration of input data by the high-dimensional dynamical reservoir results in generic stable internal states that generalize over common aspects of the input thereby allowing rapid learning from limited examples. While the random recurrent connectivity generates favorable complex dynamic activity within a reservoir, it poses unique challenges that are generally not encountered in constructing feedforward/deep learning networks. A pressing problem with recurrently connected networks is to determine the connection matrix that would be suitable for making the reservoir perform well on a particular task, because it is not entirely obvious how individual neurons should spike while interacting with other neurons. To address this, Abbott et. al 9 , proposed an elegant method for constructing recurrent spiking networks, termed as Autonomous (A) models, from continuous variable (rate) networks, called Driven (D) models. The basic idea in the D/A approach is to construct a network (Auto) that performs a particular task by copying another network (Driven) statistics that does the same task. The copying provides an estimate of the internal dynamics for the autonomous network including currents at individual neurons in the reservoir to produce the same outputs. Here, we adopt the D/A based reservoir construction approach and modify it further by introducing approximate delay apportioning to develop a recurrent arXiv:1710.07354v1 [cs.NE] 19 Oct 2017 spiking model for practical action recognition from limited video data. Please note, we use Auto/Autonomous interchangeably in the remainder of the text. Further, in order to facilitate limited example training in a reservoir spiking framework, we propose a novel spike based encoding/pre-processing method to convert the raw pixel valued videos in the dataset into spiking information that preserves the temporal statistics and correlation across different frames. This approach is inspired by how MicroSaccades (MS) cause retinal ganglion cells to fire synchronously corresponding to contrast edges after the MS. The emitted synchronous spike volley thus rapidly transmits the most salient edges of the stimulus, which often constitute the most crucial information 10 . In addition, our encoding eliminates irrelevant spiking information due to ambiguity such as, noisy background activity or jitter (due to unsteady camera movement), further making our approach more robust and reliable. Hence, our encoding, in general, captures the signature action or movement of a subject across different videos as spiking information. This, in turn, enables the reservoir to recognize/generalize over motion cues from spiking data, to enable learning various types of actions from few video samples per class. Our proposed spiking model is much more adept at learning object/activity types, due in part to our ability to analyze activity dynamically as it takes place over time. QUERY: Can you summarize the previous text?", "completion": "A fundamental challenge in machine learning today is to build a model that can learn from few examples. Here, we describe a reservoir based spiking neural model for learning to recognize actions with a limited number of labeled videos. First, we propose a novel encoding, inspired by how microsaccades influence visual perception, to extract spike information from raw video data while preserving the temporal correlation across different frames. Using this encoding, we show that the reservoir generalizes its rich dynamical activity toward signature action/movements enabling it to learn from few training examples. We evaluate our approach on the UCF-101 dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed reservoir achieves 81.3%/87% Top-1/Top-5 accuracy, respectively, on the 101-class data while requiring just 8 video examples per class for training. Our results establish a new benchmark for action recognition from limited video examples for spiking neural models while yielding competetive accuracy with respect to state-of-the-art non-spiking neural models."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: Montreal(Reuters)-Crossing the US-Canada border to go to church on a Sunday cost a US citizen $10,000for breaking Washington's strict new security rules. The expensive trip to church was a surprise for Richard Albert, who lives right on the Canadian border. Like the other half-dozen people of Township 15, crossing the border is a daily occurrence for Albert. The nearby Quebec village of St. Pamphile is where they shop, eat and go to church. There are many such situations in these areas along the largely unguarded 5,530-mile border between Canada and the US -- which in some cases actually runs down the middle of streets or through buildings. As a result, Albert says he did not expect any problems three weeks ago when he returned home to the US after attending church in Canada, as usual. The US customs station in this area is closed on Sundays, so he just drove around the locked gate, as he had done every weekend since the gate appeared last May, following a tightening of border security. Two days later, Albert was told to go to the customs office, where an officer told him he had been caught on camera crossing the border illegally. Ottawa has given out special passes to some 300 US citizens in that area so they can enter the country when Canadian customs stations are closed, but the US stopped a similar program last May. That forces the people to a 200-mile detour along hilly roads to get home through another border checkpoint. Albert has requested that the customs office change their decisions on the fine, but he has not attended a Sunday church since. \"I feel like I'm living in a prison.\" he said.

{"prompt": "TEXT: In casual language, the terms theory and model are often used interchangeably. From a technical point of view there is an important difference. Theories provide a general framework, but because of the generality of the specification, a theory cannot be shown to be useful or useless until it is fully specified in the form of a model. A model, on the other hand, needs by definition to be formulated within the concepts, along with a set of assumptions about the concepts and their relationships. The appropriateness of a model must then be evaluated with respect to a particular set of test data. The evaluation may be done by conducting a suitably designed set of empirical investigations, by rational inspection of the model assumptions in relation to the test data, or ideally both. In the strict sense, all models provide incomplete representations of the data to which they to fitted.

But just why are so many of Britains towns and cities coming to a standstill? Many motorists believe they have found the culprits  the hundreds of miles of new cycle lanes that take up swathes of roads in our busiest urban areas. Critics, including the Mail, point out that for much of the day these lanes are hardly used, leading to congestion for drivers at all times of day  not just rush hour. In London, a 913 million network of segregated cycle superhighways, introduced by former mayor Boris Johnson, is said by many to be part of the reason why average vehicle speeds in the centre of the capital have fallen to 7.4mph  slower than in the 18th century. So, are drivers really being left in the slow lane by endless bicycle lanes?

This has encouraged the computer architecture designers to explore shifting the paradigm of computation from the computing-centric models towards the fine-tuned application-specific architectures for performing a specific task with the highest performance while incurring the minimum energy cost per computation operation. Among the applications that have received considerable attention for architectural customization, the hardware accelerators for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are the most well-studied designs. To optimize the architecture design for ML/DL accelerators, a broad spectrum of methodologies have been proposed at both software and hardware levels. In the algorithm-based approaches, the data-layout compression [5] , [6] , [7] , network pruning, encoding, batch-size reduction [8] , subset selection [9] , and reduced precision representation [10] have been explored extensively in both academia and industry sectors. In particular, the employment of weights and activations with low bit-width decreases the model size and the computing complexity. For instance, in [11] , the floating-point network parameters quantized to 32-bit fixedpoint, which leads to a reduction in both data movement overhead and computation cost. Further improvement performed in [12] , where authors leveraged a 16-bit fix-point representation for weights. In [13] , hybrid representations, including both fixed and floating-point, were utilized, where some layers were quantized, while the rest have remained unchanged. This trend, reduction in precision, has been aggressively continued to compress the representative bits to 8-bit fixed-point fashions [14] , [15] , 2-bit fixed-point precision [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , [22] , [14] , and 1-bit fixed-point representation or Binarized Neural Network (BNN) [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] . It is anticipated that many industrial companies follow the scaling roadmap shown in Fig. 1 and expeditiously adopt the reduced precision representations in Deep NN (DNN) training and inference. However, the precision reduction in the representative data has exacerbated the impact of soft errors in the quantized neural network (QNN). In particular, compressing the information of a 32-bit data into few bits increases the risk of losing a significant portion of the tensors' information, which are constructed by reduced precision parameters. On the other hand, the current trend of aggressive dimension reduction in the transistors has intensified this reliability challenge. The soft errors are generally originated from high-energy particles and might strike the sequential/combinational logic in the ML/DL accelerators. The DL accelerators systematically perform the inference operation in a pre-trained network. Thus, it is expected that the neural network (NN) inference accelerator to maintain its functionality for an extended period. However, the accumulated radiation-induced transient faults can potentially impact the individual parameters in NN topology, and if not mitigated immediately, the functionality of a long-running expected NN inference accelerator can gradually downgrade by outlier contamination [29] , and lead to drastic accuracy loss. Based on our empirical observations obtained from the rigorous NN vulnerability assessment against soft errors, we observed that the weights and activation functions are unevenly susceptible to both single-event upset (SEU), and multi-bit upset (MBU) scenarios. We also noticed that not only the soft errors inconsistently influence the parameters, but the magnitude of fault-influence on the accuracy loss is subject to how early the parameters in the consecutive layers are exposed to soft errors. In this paper, we propose an entropy-based model to estimate the impact of the soft errors on the NN architectural model. Our proposed model delineates the effects of both undertaken SEU and MBU across layers and per each layer of the selected NN. The proposed model can be utilized by NN architectural developers to evaluate the error-resiliency magnitude of the NN before employing it in the safety-critical applications. In summary, our significant contributions in this paper can be listed as follows: 1) A comprehensive fault injection methodology is used to delineate the fault-skeleton map which reveals the sensitivity of each NN parameter in each layer of NN to the soft errors. 2) Based on the results collected in the previous step, we propose an entropy-based model to estimate the impact of the soft errors on the NN architectural. This model stresses on how the appearance of fault at different sequence of layers and parameters can potentially lead to drastic misclassification. 3) Our finding highlights that considering equal importance for the parameters across the layers is inaccurate, an assumption that does not hold according to our preliminary assessment of the layer importance. Our findings suggest then to consolidate traditional assumption by incorporating our preliminary finding for layer importance. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the background on convolutional NN. Section III describes the empirical observations on fault injection in the NN accelerator. Section IV explains our entropy-based model for estimating soft error impact in NN topology. In Section V, the experimental results are presented. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

These models can be potentially impacted by the radiation-induced transient faults that might lead to the gradual downgrade of the long-running expected NN inference accelerator. The crucial observation from our rigorous vulnerability assessment on the NN inference accelerator demonstrates that the weights and activation functions are unevenly susceptible to both single-event upset (SEU) and multi-bit upset (MBU), especially in the first five layers of our selected convolution neural network. In this paper, we present the relatively-accurate statistical models to delineate the impact of both undertaken SEU and MBU across layers and per each layer of the selected NN.

Its greatest breadth, on the mainland, is about 28 miles (45 km), and its total length, from the Kvarner (Quarnero) gulf to the narrows of Kotor (Cattaro), is about 233 miles (375 km). The major islands from north to south (with Italian names in parentheses) are Krk (Veglia), Cres (Cherso), Rab (Arba), Pag (Pago), Dugi Otok (Isola Lunga), Bra (Brazza), Hvar (Lesina), Vis (Lissa), Korula (Curzola), Mljet (Meleda), and Lastovo (Lagosta). A rugged and barren range of mountains, the Dinaric Alps, divides Dalmatia from the interior. With peaks ranging from 1,500 feet (450 m) to more than 6,200 feet (1,900 m), the Dinaric Alps offer only two main passes: the Krka River canyon and the Neretva River valley. The Dalmatian coastline has numerous bays and harbours and is noted for its scenic beauty. The climate is mild, with dry summers, abundant rain in autumn and winter, and very little snow. The coast of Dalmatia near Omis, Croatia. Markus Bernet Korula city, Korula island, Croatia.  swisshippo/Fotolia The first recorded inhabitants of Dalmatia were Illyrians (the name Dalmatia probably comes from the name of an Illyrian tribe, the Delmata, an Indo-European people who overran the northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula beginning about 1000 bce). The Greeks began to settle there from the 4th century, founding a number of colonies on the islands, the most famous of which were Issa (Vis), Pharos (Hvar), and Corcyra Melaina (Korula), and a few towns on the mainland coast, one of which is Salona (Solin), near modern Split. The Greeks, opposed by the Illyrians, appealed to the Romans for help, and a long series of Roman-Illyrian wars began in 229. The fall of the Dalmatian capital, Delminium, in 155 brought Roman civilization to the country. On the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Dalmatia fell under the power of Odoacer in 481 ce and later under that of Theodoric, to become a battlefield during the wars between the Goths and the Byzantine emperor Justinian I . Split, Croatia. Palestine By the time permanent Venetian rule had been established (1420), Dalmatia had passed through about 30 changes of sovereignty . Byzantines , Greeks, Magyars, Tatars, Croatian and Serbian princes, Venetians, Sicilians, and Normans were among its conquerors. The Croatian kings and the Venetian doges were the only rulers who held power long enough to leave a permanent mark on Dalmatian character and consciousness . Venetian rule , established in 1420 when the king of Croatia, Ladislas of Naples, ceded the country to the Venetian republic, ended in 1797. This period was marked by Venetian warfare against the Turks. When the French gave Venice to Austria under the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), Dalmatia became Austrian also; but in 1805, under the Treaty of Pressburg , Austria had to cede Dalmatia to Napoleon. It was returned to Austria after Napoleons fall and remained an Austrian crownland until 1918. During World War I , by the secret Treaty of London (1915), the Allies had promised large territories, including northern Dalmatia, to the Italians in return for their support. This treaty embittered negotiations for a peace settlement. Finally, the Treaty of Rapallo (November 12, 1920) between Italy and Yugoslavia gave all Dalmatia to the Yugoslavs except the mainland Zadar (Italian: Zara) enclave and the coastal islands of Cres, Loinj (Lussino), and Lastovo. The Palagruza islands, in the mid-Adriatic, also passed to Italy. During World War II , when Yugoslavia was partitioned by the Axis powers , Dalmatia was annexed by Italy, but it passed to Yugoslavia in its entirety in 1947 as part of the Croatian republic (independent from 1992), with the city of Split serving as provincial capital.

Accurate pose estimates of the human body/hand allow automated systems to perform markerless motion capture [8, 36] , recognize actions [5, 42] , understand social interactions [17] and sign languages [15] , and so on. While supervised learning methods using deep neural networks have achieved considerable success for pose estimation [26, 37, 38, 39] , the annotation of pose data is * Work done during internship at Meta Reality Labs.

Our proposed active learning and self-training techniques trained on 1,000 labeled frames (20% of the dataset) matches the performance of the fully-supervised model trained on 5,000 frames. Our framework significantly improves label efficiency for multi-view 3D pose estimation. time-consuming and costly. For example, the creators of MPII [1] , a popular body pose estimation benchmark, report that on average it takes an annotator one minute to annotate all body keypoints on an image. Human labels can also have inconsistent quality, especially for difficult occluded cases. On the other hand, multi-view camera systems [17, 44, 47] are increasingly being used to generate pose labels automatically, which is a major motivation for our work. However, the training of the underlying labeling models still requires significant upfront annotation. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the \"label efficiency\" for learning deep pose estimation models. Our approach is to focus the annotation budget on the most valuable samples, which is known as Active Learn- ing (AL) [6, 32] . Using automated sample selection strategies, AL trades computation for more expensive human labor. Also, since datasets typically have varying degrees of redundancy and may not need to be fully labeled, an AL system can greatly help to identify and reduce redundancy. We study AL formulations in the context of pose estimation; in particular, we consider 3D body and hand pose estimation from multi-view RGB images. By exploiting the use of multi-view geometry, we propose two novel AL strategies that are geometrically inspired, and easy to compute. To our knowledge, other existing AL systems for pose estimation [4, 20, 43] do not consider multi-view input, and the proposed single-view strategies therein do not generalize well to the multi-view setup. In addition to the main AL formulation, we also explore further improvements to the label efficiency with selftraining, which has been a successful strategy for image classification [27, 40, 48] . To this end, during each AL iteration we augment the human labels with pseudo-labels computed from the model's prediction, inspired by the multiview bootstrapping method [35] . Our experiments show that, with careful selection, pseudo-labels can further boost pose estimation performance without extra annotation or computational cost. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on two large-scale benchmarks, CMU Panoptic [17] for body pose estimation, and InterHand2.6M [24] for hand pose estimation. Our proposed multi-view AL strategies, together with the self-training technique, consistently outperform baseline strategies by significant margins. Notably, as shown in Fig. 1 , on CMU Panoptic our complete system is able to achieve a similar level of test error compared to the fullysupervised baseline, while only using 20% of the training labels. In summary, our contributions in this paper are threefold:  We design a framework to evaluate AL strategies for 3D pose estimation from multi-view RGB images, and propose strategies that utilize multi-view geometry to improve the label efficiency.  We explore self-training for pose estimation in the proposed AL framework, and show that further gains can be realized by including pseudo-labels.  Through empirical experiments and ablation studies, we show that the proposed AL strategies and selftraining technique significantly improve label efficiency over baselines, and establish the state-of-the-art in AL for multi-view pose estimation.

Please summarize in about 1149 words.", "completion": "Pose estimation of the human body/hand is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and learning-based solutions require a large amount of annotated data. Given limited annotation budgets, a common approach to increasing label efficiency is Active Learning (AL), which selects examples with the highest value to annotate, but choosing the selection strategy is often nontrivial. In this work, we improve Active Learning for the problem of 3D pose estimation in a multi-view setting, which is of increasing importance in many application scenarios. We develop a framework that allows us to efficiently extend existing single-view AL strategies, and then propose two novel AL strategies that make full use of multi-view geometry. Moreover, we demonstrate additional performance gains by incorporating predicted pseudo-labels, which is a form of self-training. Our system significantly outperforms baselines in 3D body and hand pose estimation on two large-scale benchmarks: CMU Panoptic Studio and InterHand2.6M.

By 1929 he allowed 40 acres of this agricultural holding into a private airfield catering to aircraft inventors and collectors of one-of-a-kind small aircraft.[3][4] The original airfield was known as Watts Airfield, named for Dr. G.E. Watts, the man most actively involved in the initial airfield development.[5] As more capital for airport expansion was needed, Watts called upon Bernard to assist with financing and management of the enlarged airport. Much of the enlargement was for construction of additional wooden hangars to support the expanding fleet of aircraft housed at this airport.[6] Around 1929 the facility was renamed Bernard's Airport, as it is shown on official maps of the area in 1948.

{"prompt": "TEXT: In Japan, companies generally expect their employees to put in long hours of overtime. But it is difficult for women, who also have household chores to do and children to take care of, to work at the same pace as men, who are not burdened with such responsibilities. Many women inevitably opt for part-time jobs, which enable them to combine work and domestic duties. At present, 23% of all female salaried workers are part- timers and the ratio has been on the rise in recent years. Part-time work places women at a disadvantage. The wages of part-time workers are considerably lower than those of full-time employees, and part-time work tends to involve menial labour. Moreover, because salary and promotion in Japanese companies are often based on seniority, it is extremely difficult for women either re-entering the labour force or switching from part-time to full-time work to climb the ladder QUERY: Given the previous premise, is the hypothesis: 'Japanese men do not share household chores and childcare with their wives.'

{"prompt": "TEXT: We focus on the setting of learning with expert advice [V90; LW94] , where in each round the learner selects a probability distribution over experts, observes the loss of each expert, and incurs the average loss of the experts under the learner's selected distribution. The learner's objective is to minimize regret against some mixture of the experts, which is the difference between their cumulative loss and the cumulative loss of the expert mixture over T rounds. The classical \"worst-case\" online learning paradigm assumes that the losses are adversarial-that is, they are chosen to make the learner perform as poorly as possible-and demands that the learner competes against the best-performing expert. However, there are many real-world settings where this assumption is too pessimistic, and consequently we focus on designing algorithms with provable guarantees that adapt to easier notions of both data and performance measures. A non-exhaustive list of work on \"easy data\" includes Freund and Schapire [FS97] , Cesa-Bianchi, Mansour, and Stoltz Contributions While the best known algorithms for the above two paradigms are intrinsically different, we show that the follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) algorithm with new root-logarithmic regularizers achieves minimax optimal performance for both quantile and semi-adversarial regret. First, we provide the first FTRL algorithm with minimax optimal quantile regret guarantees, and do so without using the additive normalization step of previous algorithms [CL06, Section 2.1]. We achieve root-KL bounds that hold uniformly over target distributions on (possibly uncountable) expert classes with arbitrary priors, and reduce to the optimal quantile regret for discrete uniform priors. Moreover, we prove matching lower bounds for quantile regret with finite expert classes, demonstrating the optimality of known upper bounds (including our own) for the first time. Finally, in the semi-adversarial paradigm, we improve the dependence on the number of experts in the regret bound, obtaining uniformly improved upper bounds over previous work. We achieve the above results through a novel local-norm analysis of FTRL with linearly decomposable regularizers on general (possibly uncountable) expert spaces. We use this analysis in conjunction with basic conditions on the first and second derivatives to design and analyze the root-logarithmic regularizers. We believe that this approach is fundamentally different from existing ones and could lead to further advances in obtaining optimal algorithms. In fact, there exist results stating if a regret bound is achievable by some algorithm, then that same bound is nearly achievable by mirror descent with some potential function (see, e.g., Srebro, Sridharan, and Tewari [SST11, Thm 9]). However, it is not clear how to design such a function in practice. In contrast, our general FTRL bound reduces the choice of regularizer to a single univariate function, and clarifies how fundamental properties of this function lead to trade-offs in the regret bound. Related Work Chernov and Vovk [CV10] first discussed the fact that the -quantile regret corresponds to the KL divergence between a uniform prior and the uniform mixture of the top N competitors, and such KL bounds have consequently quickly followed quantile regret bounds. Luo and Schapire [LS14; LS15] provided a variant of NormalHedge along with a data-dependent KL regret bound at the cost of an additional log T factor; a similar but even tighter result was obtained by Koolen and van Erven [Kv15] . Orabona and Pl [OP16] showed that these algorithms can be obtained with a reduction to optimal coin-betting online algorithms, yet none of them can be reduced to an FTRL algorithm. Independently, Harvey, Liaw, Perkins, and Randhawa [H+20] proved that a similar strategy allows one to achieve the optimal anytime regret for the setting with N = 2 experts. The first alternative to additively normalized algorithms in the (bandit) learning with experts setting was the INF algorithm [AB09] , which was later recast as online mirror descent [ABL11] . Alquier [A21] also did not use additive normalization, and first introduced FTRL with f -divergences (focusing on the  2 -divergence) along with regret bounds for continuous distributions with certain unbounded loss functions. For the specific case of Hedge (and its online mirror descent analogue), an analysis on continuous spaces was given by Krichene, Balandat, Tomlin, and Bayen [K+15] and then more generally by van der Hoeven, van Erven, and Kotowski [vvK18] , while a coarser analysis for fdivergences was given by Alquier [A21] . Finally, choosing regularizers that are tuned to minimize regret for specific tasks has recently led to advances in the online learning literature, both with bandit feedback [A+17; WL18; F+16] and in the full-information setting [LWZ18] . The best known asymptotic lower bound for learning with expert advice is by Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire, and Warmuth [C+97] , while a finite-time lower bound that asymptotically matches the leading constant was proved by Orabona and Pl [OP15a] . We are not aware of lower bounds for the quantile regret, with the notable exception of Koolen [K13] , who proved a lower bound on the regret of learning with two experts based on the KL divergence against some prior. QUERY: Please write a summary of about 1158 words based on the previous article.", "completion": "Quantile (and, more generally, KL) regret bounds, such as those achieved by NormalHedge (Chaudhuri, Freund, and Hsu 2009) and its variants, relax the goal of competing against the best individual expert to only competing against a majority of experts on adversarial data. More recently, the semi-adversarial paradigm (Bilodeau, Negrea, and Roy 2020) provides an alternative relaxation of adversarial online learning by considering data that may be neither fully adversarial nor stochastic (i.i.d.). We achieve the minimax optimal regret in both paradigms using FTRL with separate, novel, root-logarithmic regularizers, both of which can be interpreted as yielding variants of NormalHedge. We extend existing KL regret upper bounds, which hold uniformly over target distributions, to possibly uncountable expert classes with arbitrary priors; provide the first full-information lower bounds for quantile regret on finite expert classes (which are tight); and provide an adaptively minimax optimal algorithm for the semi-adversarial paradigm that adapts to the true, unknown constraint faster, leading to uniformly improved regret bounds over existing methods."}
{"prompt": "TEXT: Ongoing high levels of perceived workload can have a negative impact on the well-being and health [2] . Recent research has revealed concerning rates of anxiety and depression among university students [3] . Every individual can perceive a task with different levels of workload. For example, for a Computer Science student, writing a program to compute Fibonacci numbers may be easy, but it would be hard for a student from the philosophy department. Traditionally, perceived workload can be assessed with self-reports. However, collecting these reports can be a challenging task. In recent years, researchers experimented with wearable sensor technologies for identifying high workload. However, many of the investigated technologies were high-end sensor systems like full-lead electrocardiography (ECG) [4] and electroencephalography (EEG) [5] , which do not provide high-comfort. Consumer-grade out-of-the-box smartwatches and smartbands can be used to monitor the perceived workload in daily life because they are unobtrusive, comfortable to wear and cost-efficient. Modern smartwatches are promising candidates for daily life perceived workload detection since they are equipped with built-in sensors including heart rate monitor, accelerometer and gyroscope. The photoplethysmography (PPG) based heart rate monitoring (HRM) units of popular smartwatches such as Samsung Gear Series and Apple Watch provide less data than high-end sensor systems (sampling frequency 1000+ Hz vs less than 100 Hz) and more vulnerable to the artifacts which make the decision process of the proposed system harder (see Figure 1 for IBI data comparison of ECG and PPG sensors). Generally, The difference between the IBI data obtained from an ECG sensor and a PPG sensor. ECG data has a structure which composes of P, Q, R, S, T data points [1] whereas we can only obtain peaks from PPG data for capturing heartbeats. the number of valid RR intervals from full-lead ECG signals is about 99%, whereas the same value for the smartwatches can drop to 50% [6] which makes the system developed in the laboratory to fail in the wild settings. Perceived workload detection in the wild settings is harder than laboratory settings, due to the dependence on the self-reports, selection of unobtrusive devices and less information about the task that the user is engaging. More sophisticated approaches for daily life settings are required. Recently, more and more engineering problems have been solved with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) since they are powerful tools with high performance. For automatic workload detection systems using physiological data, researchers needed a neural network that could take advantage of the sequential structure of the data. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is a particular type of RNN. It was defined by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 [7] to alleviate the long-term dependency problem of RNN [8] . Because of the vanishing/exploding gradient problem as a result of backpropagation through time in a standard RNN, a long sequential data could be hard to learn [8] . In LSTM, instead of an RNN cell, a gated LSTM cell is used to cope with this problem. This makes LSTM suitable for sequential data classification. Chauchan et al. [9] showed that LSTM can be implemented on a smartwatch and a smartphone, and works faster than the shallow SVM. In this study, we improved the state of the art by combining two important features as shown in Table 1 . First, our system tested and trained in the wild with self-reported questionnaires without any restriction of a certain task, and with the consumer-grade smartwatches which makes it scalable. Most of the previous works are tested on a certain type of task like the N-Back task less than a week. Detecting workload in the wild settings without restricting the task type is more challenging. Ground truth collection is solely based on questionnaires in the wild whereas the workload level is known at any moment in the restricted environments. When the unrestricted movements and resulting artifacts, low data quality of unobtrusive devices, subjectivity of the perceived workload obtained from questionnaires are taken into account, the performance of perceived workload detection systems in the wild is lower than the systems tested in the laboratory environments. Second, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt that applies LSTM for daily life perceived workload detection with consumer-grade smartwatches. We compared the prediction performance of LSTM with a shallow network and the traditional machine learning algorithms on the perceived workload data coming from daily life. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the related work for automatic workload detection systems in daily life. In Section 3, we present the proposed smartwatch based workload detection platform. In Section 5, we explained the data collection procedure. In Section 4, we provide the results of the proposed system. In Section 6, we evaluate the findings of the study and future work of the current research. QUERY: Generate a summary for the text.", "completion": "Continuous high perceived workload has a negative impact on the individual's well-being. Prior works focused on detecting the workload with medical-grade wearable systems in the restricted settings, and the effect of applying deep learning techniques for perceived workload detection in the wild settings is not investigated. We present an unobtrusive, comfortable, pervasive and affordable Long Short-Term Memory Network based continuous workload monitoring system based on a smartwatch application that monitors the perceived workload of individuals in the wild. We make use of modern consumer-grade smartwatches. We have recorded physiological data from daily life with perceived workload questionnaires from subjects in their real-life environments over a month. The model was trained and evaluated with the daily-life physiological data coming from different days which makes it robust to daily changes in the heart rate variability, that we use with accelerometer features to asses low and high workload. Our system has the capability of removing motion-related artifacts and detecting perceived workload by using traditional and deep classifiers. We discussed the problems related to in the wild applications with the consumer-grade smartwatches. We showed that Long Short-Term Memory Network outperforms traditional classifiers on discrimination of low and high workload with smartwatches in the wild."}

Troy Sowers of Knoxville, Tennessee, had hoped for a 'very simple' final day with 'coffee and doughnuts' to end his decades of service but colleagues had a different plan in mind. They tracked-downStewart Rembert, now a U.S. Marine corporal, who Sowers had saved only a few months into the job in 1997 when he was still a rookie.

'My parents wanted me to give you a hug,' he told a shocked Sowers before embracing him. 'I wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity of a life.' Sowers described the reunion as 'probably one of the best surprises I've ever had,' adding that he had always wondered what happened to little Rembert. Recalling the case from Tacoma in Washington, he told the crowd that the child had been missing for 19 hours when they convinced the abductor to talk. She had taken him from a hospital in Lakewood in 1997 causing panic among Rembert's parents and medical staff. But following on from a tip, Sowers had convinced the kidnapper to show them where she had left the boy. By that point, several hours on from when she left him, Sowers explained that he feared the baby would be dead. Sowers said: 'I pulled a baby out of a box...

{"prompt": "TEXT: Ponte Vecchio, Florence | A Medieval Bridge Of Shops | HappyTrips.com Amusing Planet | THINGS TO DO , FLORENCE Many centuries ago, bridges served many purposes. Aside from getting you over water, it was common for medieval bridges to have chapels and shops built over them, and many were fortified with towers and ramparts because bridges served important entry points to the cities. The Ponte Vecchio or the 'Old Bridge' over the Arno River, in Florence, Italy, is a medieval stone bridge noted for still having shops built along it. The first bridge over Arno River was probably built by the Romans in stone and wood and is mentioned in a document that dates from 996. The bridge was swept away in a flood in 1117 and was rebuilt in stone only to be destroyed again by another flood in 1333, save for its two central piers. Consequently, the bridge was rebuilt again, twelve years later, designed by the Italian painter and architect Giotto's most talented pupil Taddeo Gaddi, who was a painter and architect in his own right. Today, the Arno River is spanned by six bridges all of which can be crossed on foot or by cars, except Ponte Vecchio, which doesn't allow vehicular traffic. That's because this iconic medieval bridge is always crowded with shoppers. The Ponte Vecchio has been home to shops across its span since the 13th century. Merchants would sell their goods on tables after receiving approval to do so from the proper authorities. When a merchant couldn't pay his debts, the table on which he sold his wares (the \"banco\") was physically broken (\"rotto\") by soldiers, effectively shutting down their business. This practice was called 'bancorotto' and is believed that the economic concept of bankruptcy originated here. The shops belonged to the commune and were rented out, originally to butchers, fishmongers, and tanners. But these merchants produced so much garbage and foul stench, that Duke Ferdinando de' Medici threw them out and replaced them with goldsmiths. The problem was that the Vasari Corridor that connects Florence's town hall with the palace of the ruling family, passes over the Ponte Vecchio and had to bear the foul smell. So the duke decided that the new occupants of the bridge should be goldsmiths. Jewellers still make up a majority of the Ponte Vecchio shops today. In fact, some of Florence's best jewelers sell their creations on this medieval bridge. There are also some art studios and souvenir shops. Towards the 15th century, the shops that were originally on rent were sold to private owners and they began to alter the superstructure adding external terraces and rooms that extended towards the river supporting on wooden props. By the 17th century the bridge had taken on a chaotic appearance that we see today. During the Second World War, when the Germans withdrew from Italy back to Germany , they destroyed many fine bridges in Italy to thwart the advances of the allies. All the bridges in Florence were blown up, but Ponte Vecchio was spared. Instead they blocked access by demolishing the medieval buildings on each side. Even Adolf Hitler recognised that destroying Ponte Vecchio would be a crime too many. Liked this article? Let your friends know about it Was this helpful?

Then we consider an exactly solvable field theoretical model in which the electro-magnetic interactions are effectively local. Finally, we use the effective field theory formalism to develop an exactly solvable model in which we also include the effect of non-local interactions. We find that such interactions turn the nominally metallic armchair graphene nanoribbon into a semi-conductor, while the short-range interactions lead to a correction to the G=4 e^2/h formula.

{"prompt": "TEXT: On a blazing hot summer night in 1906 on the rooftop of Madison Square Garden, Harry Thaw, heir to a $40 million railroad fortune, crept up behind Stanford White  a revered New York City architect and socialite. As a choir sang the closing notes to Mam'zelle Champagne on the venue's rooftop, Thaw raised a pistol inches from White's head, and fired three shots. The bullets went straight through his left eye, killing him. When asked by police why he did it, Thaw's answer was simple: 'He deserved it. He ruined my wife.' In the investigation that ensued, a tragic and bizarre 'love triangle' was revealed between the architect, the millionaire, and his model wife  New York City's first 'it-girl' Evelyn Nesbit. She was the crux of the conflict, a stupefying young beauty, whose tragic story was the backbone of what became known as the Trial of the Century. Evelyn was just 15 when she began modelling in New York City, and she looked even younger. She quickly skyrocketed to popularity in the magazine industry, and graced the covers of Cosmopolitan, Vanity Fair, and Harper's Bazaar in the early 1900s. The image of her copper-brown tresses and pale skin were plastered on postcards, beer trays and tobacco cards. Her often sexual poses earned her the title of the world's first pin-up girl, and she later worked with one of the first fashion photographers, Joel Feder as a live model  staged in various costumes, such as a wood nymph, gypsy, geisha, and Grecian goddess. Evelyn's father passed away when she was young,she became the sole breadwinner for her family. Even though she was making $10 a day in the early 20th century - the equivalent of about $275 today - she and her mother and younger brother lived together in a single room in the back of a building on 22nd street and apparently struggled to make ends meet despite Evelyn's income. When she made her debut into the Broadway circuit as a chorus girl in the play Florodora, her graduation into the New York City elite was cemented. No one was more invested in Evelyn's success than Stanford White, an architect whose firm constructed the second Madison Square Garden, Washington Square Arch, and mansions for the Vanderbilts.

Nesbit had revealed to her husband that White sexually assaulted her when she was 16-years-old in his West 24th Street playhouse. Despite this, she and White went on to have a years-long affair and just before she died at the age of 82 in 1967 she described him as 'the most wonderful man I ever knew'. Thaw was found to be criminally insane after two trials, due to the high profile nature of the case. It was the first trial in United States history that a jury was sequestered for, and became known as the 'Trial of the Century'."}

The striker, knowing he was about to be taken off by manager Brendan Rodgers following a poor 45 minutes, decided to grab himself a wearable souvenir a little earlier than is custom. But although his actions attracted widespread criticism, it is by no means the first time two players have decided to swap shirts at half-time. We take a look back at some of the other occasions when shirts have been swapped prematurely. Andre Santos and Robin Van Persie Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal - November 4, 2012 Andre Santos ran after his former team-mate and asked to swap shirts as the players headed down the Old Trafford tunnel. Van Persie had just joined United for 24m and had scored after just three minutes of this match. Santos was privately reprimanded by manager Arsene Wenger but claimed the half-time swapping of shirts is a custom in Brazil. Unfortunately, that doesn't translate to England and Santos found himself a scapegoat for a poor team performance. Neymar and Robinho AC Milan 1-1 Barcelona - October 22, 2013 Neymar had paid tribute to his idol Robinho in the build-up to this Champions League tie last year and he seemed in a hurry to get his shirt. Robinho had opened the scoring at the San Siro, only for Lionel Messi to equalise, and the two exchanged shirts as they walked off at the break. Both players started their careers at Santos in Brazil before big money moves to Europe. Mamadou Sakho and Samuel Eto'o Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool - December 29, 2013 As referee Howard Webb blew for half-time at Stamford Bridge in this clash last season, Mamadou Sakho of Liverpool and Chelsea's Samuel Eto'o decided to get the swapping over and done with. What's more, TV cameras also picked up Oscar and Philippe Coutinho, both Brazilians, swapping jerseys too. It led to a backlash on Twitter, with fans calling for the players to be taken off at half-time. Ronaldinho and Paolo Ferreira Chelsea 4-2 Barcelona - March 8, 2005 This Champions League tie was a classic as Chelsea turned around a first-leg deficit to dump Barcelona out on a memorable evening at Stamford Bridge. To add further intrigue, Ronaldinho and Ferreira decided to swap shirts as they trooped off at half-time. The Brazilian star had scored twice during the opening period.

{"prompt": "TEXT: According to Jubilees 9, the region between Tigris and Euphrates was alloted to Aram. His brother Asshur originally received land east of the Tigris. The land from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, went to their brother Arphaxad, whose son built Ur Kesed on the south bank of the Euphrates (usually assumed to be Ur - not anything near the Khabur). Abraham (a descendant of Arphaxad) *LEFT* Ur to go *TO* Padan Aram, lots of revisionists nowadays are trying to make Ur somewhere within Padam Aram, but the evidence is slim.  () 16:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC) Actually, Ur Kasdim as being in Aram Naharaim is directly alluded to in the Biblical text itself. Abraham does not go from Ur *to* \"Padan Aram\", he leaves Ur then goes to Haran, and only then is he asked to leave his \"country, father's house, and nativity to a land that I will show you\". Later Abraham, ask his servant to return the \"land of my nativity\" to get a wife for his son, and where does he send him to? To Haran, in Aram Naharaim. There is no evidence whatsoever in the narrative of Genesis that Ur was any great distance from Haran. The Bible reminds us time and time again that when Araham and his family are in Haran and Aram Naharaim, they are hanging around *their own turf*, so to speak, and did not migrate their from 100's of miles downstream from a foreign metropolis seaport. Furthermore, in Deuteronomy 26:6, the Israelites are explicitly reminded that their \"father was a wandering Aramaean\", not an Akkadian, not a Babylonian, not a Sumerian, not anything from lower Mesopotamia, nor even a Chaldean. The 5 books of Moses are explicit in not associating the Hebrew patriarchs with Sumer (Shinar), Babylon, or Akkad. There is no mention of a land called 'Chaldea' in the Torah. The cities of Shinar were founded by Nimrod, descended from Ham, and others by Asshur, son of Shem. Aram son of Shem is regarded as the ancestor of the Arameans of cis-Euphratine Syria (Damascus and Zobah). But there is another Aram, mentioned in Genesis 22, along with Kesed (the only allusion to the Kasdim in the 5 books of Moses other than in reference to Ur itself), and they are descended from Nahor, Abraham's brother, from Haran. This Aram is commonly associated with Aram Naharaim, as opposed to Aram of Shem. The book of Jubilees is not a canonical Biblical book, tellingly has not been preserved in Hebrew, and cannot be cited as a source of information regarding ancient Biblical traditions. It is a late Hellenistic era tradition, but suffice it to mention that many Hellenistic-era authors did not associate the Hebrew patriarchs with lower Babylon either. Confusion must have arisen due to the fact that the Chaldeans ended up in Babylon, but again, later canonical books of the Bible are explicit in saying that the Chaldeans were newcomers to that region as well, and not native to Babylon from the time of the patriarchs. Note, I haven't even touched on the archeological evidence associating the patriarchal names and traditions with upper Mesopotamia. J.D. Preceding unsigned comment added by 205.68.95.65 (talk) 16:43, 29 January 2008 (UTC) In my opinion, the question that should be asked ought to be \"what is the evidence AGAINST Abraham's Ur and the original Kasdim being in Aram Naharaim\"? J.D. Preceding unsigned comment added by 205.68.95.65 (talk) 23:03, 29 January 2008 (UTC) So, what I have been able to understand so far is that in the Hebrew midrash 'Sefer ha Yashar', pg.58, Aram son of Kemuel is named as the founder of Aram Naharaim. In the same Midrash, the Radak (Rabbi David Kimhi) names Kesed from the same family as a possible ancestor of the Kasdim. http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=22 Similarly, the Hellenistic-era Septuagint spefically mentions in Gen. 22 \"Kamuel, the father of the Syrians\" and his brother \"Chasad\".

{"prompt": "TEXT: Some people think that carrying any balance on credit cards will damage your FICO score, but the opposite is usually true. Making regular payments on very small account balances shows that you are a responsible credit holder. You can keep a good FICO score by managing how much of your available credit you use and making your payments on time. Keep low balances on credit cards and other \"revolving\" credit accounts. Too many cards close to the \"max\" limits can raise a red flag. Don't have balances on too many credit accounts at once, especially credit cards. This can indicate that you're overextending yourself, and suggests to lenders that you won't be able to pay them. Dont close old accounts to raise your FICO score. In most cases, this might actually lower your FICO score because it will reduce your available credit percentage. Any late payments or other negative items from those accounts will still affect your FICO score. Open new accounts only as needed. You should aim for a healthy mix of credit accounts.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Statistical models are increasingly recognized in medical image analysis and particularly in our domain of interest: computer-assisted orthopedic surgery [1] . The Statistical Shape Model (SSM) enables an efficient parameterized representation of the shape even when only a few shape instances are available [2, 3] . It is not only useful for the compact modeling of the anatomical shape variation in the dataset but also to generate new shapes simi-lar to the original data and to reconstruct missing parts of shapes [4, 5] . Shape reconstruction is usually performed using a SSM and some constraints which encompass the difference between the SSM and the intact part of the shape. These constraints will guide the deformation of the SSM and fit it to the partial present part of the shape and predict the missing part. Several approaches have been proposed in this context, mainly different in the way of building the SSM or in the type of constraints used. Zhang and Besier [6] and Blanc et al. [7] used sparse observations and morphometric data as the constraints. Bernard et al. [4] used sparse point data and employed Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to adjust the SSM. Rajamani et al. [8] performed reconstruction using a few landmarks and surface points and a least-squares minimization approach. Albrecht et al. [9] introduced posterior SSM to predict the best matching shape. While most of these works focus on developing new algorithms for shape prediction, an issue that has not been fully investigated is the impact of the quality of the constraints on the reconstruction performance. In this study, we assessed the impact of the position, the noise, and the number of easily reachable bony landmarks (as the constraints to guide the deformations) for the non-invasive reconstruction of a femur, and for the estimation of its mechanical axis: the axis between the hip and the knee centers. Several strategies regarding the acquisition of landmarks have been investigated and compared, either landmark directly digitized on the bone surface such as for instance, during knee surgery or through the skin, i.e., in a non-invasive way (see Fig. 1 ). These findings could have great importance either for orthopedics or rehabilitation, to the further non-invasive estimation of clinical parameters which allows an optimal assistance for the placement of knee implant, or for improving the preoperative or postoperative patient's followup. The reconstruction of the femur bone from partial data allows the determination of specific lower limb parameters such as the hip joint center or the mechanical axis. The mechanical axis is a crucial clinical indicator for lower limb alignment, allowing the assessment of the patient biomechanical balance in rehabilitation and orthopedics [10] . The precise alignment of the lower limb also has a crucial role in knee joint-related surgeries [11, 12] . QUERY: Condense the text down to the essentials.", "completion": "In this study, we investigated a method allowing the determination of the femur bone surface as well as its mechanical axis from some easy-to-identify bony landmarks. The reconstruction of the whole femur is therefore performed from these landmarks using a Statistical Shape Model (SSM). The aim of this research is therefore to assess the impact of the number, the position, and the accuracy of the landmarks for the reconstruction of the femur and the determination of its related mechanical axis, an important clinical parameter to consider for the lower limb analysis. Two statistical femur models were created from our in-house dataset and a publicly available dataset. Both were evaluated in terms of average point-to-point surface distance error and through the mechanical axis of the femur. Furthermore, the clinical impact of using landmarks on the skin in replacement of bony landmarks is investigated. The predicted proximal femurs from bony landmarks were more accurate compared to on-skin landmarks while both had less than 3.5 degrees mechanical axis angle deviation error. The results regarding the non-invasive determination of the mechanical axis are very encouraging and could open very interesting clinical perspectives for the analysis of the lower limb either for orthopedics or functional rehabilitation."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: Since the discovery of the first extra-solar planets, we are confronted with the puzzling diversity of planetary systems. Processes like planet radial migration in gas-disks and planetary orbital instabilities, often invoked to explain the exotic orbits of the extra-solar planets, at first sight do not seem to have played a role in our system. In reality, though, there are several aspects in the structure of our Solar System that cannot be explained in the classic scenario of in-situ formation and smooth evolution of the giant planets. This paper describes a new view of the evolution of the outer Solar System that emerges from the so-called 'Nice model' and its recent extensions. The story provided by this model describes a very \"dynamical\" Solar System, with giant planets affected by both radial migrations and a temporary orbital instability. Thus, the diversity between our system and those found so far around other stars does not seem to be due to different processes that operated here and elsewhere, but rather stems from the strong sensitivity of chaotic evolutions to small differences in the initial and environmental conditions.

The 38-year-old from London, has been held since April last year after travelling to the country with her daughter on holiday. Her three-year-old is brought to see her in prison twice a week where they are allowed to 'hug and play together'. As her British husband Richard Ratcliffe described the toll on his wife and daughter, pressure is still growing on Boris Johnson to sort out the mess created by his recent gaffe and secure Mrs Zachary-Ratcliffe's freedom.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Coronal hole spatial-temporal evolution is studied and comparison made with that of the solar global magnetic field in cycles 21-23 (1976-2012). The latitude-longitude distribution dynamics of coronal holes and the regularities in the global magnetic field associated with the solar polar field reversal are analyzed. Polar and non-polar coronal hole populations are considered. The investigation reveals some temporal and spatial regularities in coronal hole distributions that match well the global magnetic-field cycle evolution. The results show that the non-polar coronal hole longitudinal distribution follows all configuration changes in the global magnetic-field structure. Reorganizations of the global magnetic-field and coronal hole distributions occur simultaneously during a time interval of a few solar rotations. The cycle evolution of the non-polar coronal holes reflects the transition of the solar global magnetic field from the zonal structure to sectorial andvice versa. Two different type waves of non-polar coronal holes are revealed from their latitudinal distribution. The first one is short poleward waves. They trace the poleward motion of the unipolar photospheric magnetic fields from approximately 35 deg to the associated pole in each hemisphere and the redevelopment of a new-polarity polar CH. Although they start the poleward movement before the change of the polar magnetic field in the associated hemisphere, they reach the pole after the polar reversal. The other type of non-polar CH wave forms two sinusoidal branches associated with the positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields. The complete period of the wave was equal to approximately 268 CRs (22 years). These wave CHs arrive at high latitudes during declining phases when the new polarity polar CHs are already completely formed. QUERY: Which of the following could be the title of the preceding paper?

Please summarize in about 1506 words.", "completion": "We introduce a Deep Stochastic IOC RNN Encoderdecoder framework, DESIRE, for the task of future predictions of multiple interacting agents in dynamic scenes. DESIRE effectively predicts future locations of objects in multiple scenes by 1) accounting for the multi-modal nature of the future prediction (i.e., given the same context, future may vary), 2) foreseeing the potential future outcomes and make a strategic prediction based on that, and 3) reasoning not only from the past motion history, but also from the scene context as well as the interactions among the agents. DESIRE achieves these in a single end-to-end trainable neural network model, while being computationally efficient. The model first obtains a diverse set of hypothetical future prediction samples employing a conditional variational autoencoder, which are ranked and refined by the following RNN scoring-regression module. Samples are scored by accounting for accumulated future rewards, which enables better long-term strategic decisions similar to IOC frameworks. An RNN scene context fusion module jointly captures past motion histories, the semantic scene context and interactions among multiple agents. A feedback mechanism iterates over the ranking and refinement to further boost the prediction accuracy. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets: KITTI and Stanford Drone Dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: Police have slammed a 'misleading' video that claimed to show masked vigilantes destroying a drug dealer's car - supposedly as a response to a failure to combat crime in the area. The video, which surfaced last week, warned criminals in Blackrod, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, that they were 'playing with the wrong vigilantes' amid reports of drug dealers and car thieves being confronted in the streets. It showed a man clad in a balaclava attacking what he said was a suspected drug dealer's car with an axe.He then winched it up 10ft in the air on a forklift truck and drops it to the ground. HoweverChief Inspector Clark Bowers of Greater Manchester Police's Bolton Borough, said that while the video 'appears to be very real', it was 'fake news'. 'It is not a true reflection of the people of Blackrod nor of the current picture of crime in the area and it is very misleading,' he said. He added that police had identified the person in the video and established that it was staged. However, he added, 'although it was not a good decision to make, there was no malicious intent.' 'Unfortunately, before we were able to investigate this fully, it was shared a number of times on social media and used by some newspapers, causing unnecessary worry and panic. He appealed to residents to 'work with us, not against us' - but admitted police were 'not always able to investigate every crime when there aren't forensic opportunities, CCTV or a likelihood of a conviction. But, he said, 'please, let us be the ones to make that assessment.' While it the Blackrod video was apparently staged, vigilante groups elsewhere have been increasingly taking crime fighting into their own hands, with volunteerspatrolling the streets of Basildon and Wickford in Essex in a bid to deter gangs, prevent break-ins and stop vandalism.

{"prompt": "TEXT: BBC bosses are planning to toughen enforcement of the licence fee after a spike in the number of people evading the charge. The evasion rate rose from five per cent in 2014/5 to seven per cent last year according to data from the House of Commons Library with an increase of each of the last three years. There are around 25.8 million active TV licences in the UK, which suggests around 1.9million house-holds are not paying the annual 150.50 charge, the Times reported. Licence fee dodging is most prominent in Scotland where one in ten addresses that should have a TV licences do not, with the rate being about six per cent in England and Wales. The BBC has a target evasion rate of just 3.95 per cent by 2019 but bosses have accepted that a more realistic target of six per cent by 2021. To help reach the new target, Television Licensing, which enforces the fee, is expanding efforts to catch people who lie about not owning a TV or claim to only use it for DVDs and Netflix. According to the National Audit Office (NAO), which oversees the BBCs finances, corporation will increase the number of licenses through better field enforcement activities and improved identification of false No Licence Needed declarations. Capita, the outsourcing firm who hold enforcement contract, have been involved in scandals over aggressive staff incentive schemes aimed at maximising collections. The Daily Mail has previously exposed the underhand tactics used by the BBCs licence fee officers. Failing to cut license fee dodging costs the BBC tens of millions of pounds a year, a figure that will come under the spotlight as the broadcaster looks to scrap free TV licences for over-75s. The BBC is currently consulting on its proposal to reform or restrict the age-related giveaway, which currently costs a huge 745 million a year. From 2019 the BBC rather than the government will have to pay for the cost of the subsidy. The spike in evasion rates is down to a miscalculation of how many households should have a license says the BBC. In 2016 the number of addresses needing a licence rose after the so-called iPlayer loophole, which exempted people who only watched programmes on catch up, from the charge. Failing to cut evasion remains a concern said the NAO while TV licensing said evasion rates had not significantly changed and blamed new methodology for the two percentage point rise.

To the administration assistant, of Queens, New York, it's just a harmless hobby. But, not everybody understands her interest in them, with some people dubbing the dolls 'creepy'.

Evans was left awaiting the winner of Moldova's Radu Albot and American McKenzie MacDonald. Both are ranked in the eighties and eminently beatable. The GB number three is already assured a new ranking of around 105 which should see him assured of main draw entries into the French Open at Wimbledon. Winning the final would put him up to around 85. It has been impressive progress for someone who only returned to action in late April last year to start again from scratch after a year's ban for being found to have taken cocaine. His previous appearance in a main tour ATP final was in January 2017 when he lost to Gilles Muller at the Sydney International. He will attempt to follow Kyle Edmund, who in October won the Antwerp Open. Evans' campaign at Delray Beach began a week ago in the qualifying event, which he came through as part of a season that has seen him win fifteen matches already. Currently ranked 148, he was faced with trying to defuse the power serving of World No 9 Isner. He managed to break his 6' 10' opponent twice in the second set and once early on in the decider, holding on comfortably thereafter to register one of the best wins of his career. Evans said afterwards: 'I'm moving well, I'm moving pretty good, I think I'm difficult to play. I started to see his serve pretty well. 'I wouldn't say I was guessing, but I was sort of anticipating and got it right, other days I could be looking stupid going one way when he puts it another.'

QUERY: Write a 2360-word article with the previous text as the main content.", "completion": "A scientist has named the 36 'longevity' nutrients - found in everything from red meat to noodles - that could 'add a few years to everyone's lives'. Consuming plenty of the three dozen vitamins and minerals prevents disease and the risk of an early death, Dr Bruce Ames claims. However, Dr Ames, of the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute claim that most people are deficient in many of the nutrients. Below, MailOnline names the 36 nutrients, from vitamin K to selenium, and reveals how they benefit your health and the foods richest in them. Dr Ames, who led the study, said: 'Diet is very important for our long-term health. 'This just reinforces that you should try to do what your mother told you: Eat your veggies, eat your fruit, give up sugary soft drinks and empty carbohydrates. 'The low hanging fruit in prolonging healthy ageing lies in optimising vitamin and mineral intake.' He published the list of nutrients in thejournal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Ames said around70 per cent of people in the US are deficient in vitamin D and as many as 60 per cent lack vitamin E. This is despite vitamin D being essential for bone, heart and brain health, and vitamin E protecting against skin and eye damage. Dr Ames made the conclusion by evaluating research conducted by himself and his colleagues, as well as other scientists from around the world. This is based on the theory that when a person lacks certain vitamins and minerals, their body uses the nutrients it does have to ensure their survival. This is rather than investing the nutrients into helping them live longer or preventing disease. For example, a vitamin K deficiency may cause a person's to use the vitamin K it has to ensure blood properly clots, rather than investing it into heart health. While deficiency in 'longevity vitamins' may not put someone at immediate risk of death, it can cause gradual damage that only becomes obvious in later life. Ensuring lifelong health is increasingly important due to people all over the world living longer, Dr Ames said. '[The current review] may be a theoretical paper, but I hope it can add a few years to everyone's lives,' he added. Although factors aside from diet can cause disease, such as infections and genetics, eating well strengthens the immune system so it can then better fight pathogens off."}
{"prompt": "TEXT: Documents can be classified into various classes based on their text contents and/or their structural properties. During a manual search for a particular document from a large collection of documents, knowledge about the type or structure of the document helps reduce the time necessary for the search. However, the automatic accomplishment of the same is a challenging task. In an early study [1] , it was observed that a real-life document can be viewed in different ways, in both geometric and logical structure spaces. The authors observed that effective understanding of the document structure can be realized through the use of an expert system and pattern classification methods. Automatic classification of document images is an effective initial step of various Document Image Processing (DIP) tasks such as document retrieval, information extraction and text recognition, among others. The performance of a DIP system may be enhanced through efficient initial classification of an Preprint Copy. Accepted in 24th International Conference in Pattern Recognition (ICPR), Beijing, China, 2018. input document into a number of pre-determined categories. Automatic classification also has a significant role in indexing the documents of a Digital Library. It has been seen that any large volume of documents from different categories can be better organized provided these are first classified into several categories based on their structures [2] . With increased usage of digital means of document exchange and the growth in volume of digitized documents, the requirement of an automatic system capable of understanding their logical structures is felt significantly for better management of these documents including their efficient archiving, retrieval, information mining and so on. However, the development of an automatic system for classification of arbitrary document images into their respective true categories is computationally a non-trivial task in contrast to the case of human beings. The complexity of this task is increased due to inter-class similarity and intra-class variability issues in documents. For example, an advertisement may look like a news item or a form may be very dense with items arranged in multiple columns while another form may have only a few items with each item in a distinct horizontal row and the rows are separated wide apart. This is demonstrated by the examples shown in Fig. 1 . Intuitively, from the perspective of a classifier, documents can be characterized by their text content or structural information [3] . Document classifiers based on text contents use optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract the texts in the document image and thus are susceptible to OCR errors. On the other hand, there are OCR systems which follow a structural analysis approach by first determining the class of the document image based on which an appropriate OCR module is employed [4] . The effectiveness of such systems hinges on that of the structure classification techniques employed and hence speaks for the utility of structure learning as an important aspect of document understanding.

The contribution of this work involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective ensembling for document image classification. A primary level of `inter-domain' transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16 architecture on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole document images. Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a secondary level of `intra-domain' transfer learning is used for rapid training of deep learning models for image segments. Finally, stacked generalization based ensembling is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep neural network models. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.2% on the popular RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding benchmarks set by existing algorithms."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: In many machine learning applications, e.g. in the medical domain [5] , the models need to be explainable, or they will not be very useful. Obviously this means that the model needs to communicate to the user somehow what has led it to the given conclusion instead of just being a black-box [13] . Another important factor in model explainability is the information how reliable the given prediction is. This property is called classifier calibration. A well calibrated classifier prediction is such that the predicted probability of an event is close to the proportion of the those events among a group of similar predictions [6] . However, the main design objective for classifiers tends to be good class separation and not accurate reliability estimation. Therefore, many classifiers are not well calibrated out of the box. To improve this probability estimate, accurate classifier calibration algorithms are needed. With accurate calibration, almost any model can output a good estimate of the probability that the decision it has made is indeed correct [23] . Accurate probability estimates are also important for cost sensitive decision making [31] . For calibration algorithms to work well, a minimum of about 1000 to 2000 training samples are needed for the calibration data set depending on the learning algorithm to avoid overfitting. This is especially true for non-parametric calibration algorithms and calibration seems to improve further with even bigger calibration data sets [23, 24] . To avoid biasing the calibration model, a separate calibration data set is needed. This means that the amount of training data in total needs to be large. E.g. if 10 % of the training data set is used for calibration and the rest for modelling, a training data set with at least 10 000 samples is needed. In addition, a separate data set needs to be held out for testing. Figure 1 illustrates the data set partitioning. In many real world modelling tasks, however, relatively small data sets are quite common. As we will demonstrate in this article, traditional calibration algorithms fail to deliver on small data sets. But with our proposed data generation approach, calibration can often be improved despite the data set being small. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Literature in calibration with a view on small data sets is briefly reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, a set of experiments is described. The results of the experiments are summarized in Section 4 and presented in more detail in the Appendix. To conclude the article, the results are discussed in Section 5. QUERY: Please write a summary of about 1129 words based on the previous article.", "completion": "Classifier calibration does not always go hand in hand with the classifier's ability to separate the classes. There are applications where good classifier calibration, i.e. the ability to produce accurate probability estimates, is more important than class separation. When the amount of data for training is limited, the traditional approach to improve calibration starts to crumble. In this article we show how generating more data for calibration is able to improve calibration algorithm performance in many cases where a classifier is not naturally producing well-calibrated outputs and the traditional approach fails. The proposed approach adds computational cost but considering that the main use case is with small data sets this extra computational cost stays insignificant and is comparable to other methods in prediction time. From the tested classifiers the largest improvement was detected with the random forest and naive Bayes classifiers. Therefore, the proposed approach can be recommended at least for those classifiers when the amount of data available for training is limited and good calibration is essential."}

In 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the countrys monarch. In 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeths death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o Field, and Marys lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James. In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death. On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mothers execution, and upon Queen Elizabeths death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Authorities in America have been fighting for Mr Love, who has Asperger syndrome, to face trial on charges of cyber-hacking, which his lawyers say could mean a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if he is found guilty. ButEdward Fitzgerald QC told Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley there were 'overwhelming reasons of justice and humanity' why any trial should take place in the UK. Mr Love, 32, who has Asperger syndrome and lives with his parents near Newmarket in Suffolk, sat in the packed High Court in London, as Mr Fitzgerald listed the reasons for challenging extradition, including a 'high risk' of suicide if he is sent to the US. He is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, NASA and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. In September 2016 a district judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court ruled that Mr Love could be extradited. The current proceedings, due to last two days, centre on that ruling made by District Judge Nina Tempia. It is argued on Mr Love's behalf that she 'misdirected herself and erred in law in her conclusions'. Mr Fitzgerald said there was a 'compelling' need for Mr Love, who also suffers from a depressive illness and severe eczema, to stay in this country with the care and support of his family. He submitted that the 'proper place for him to be tried, if he is to be tried, is in the UK and not in the US'. Mr Fitzgerald told the court: 'The very fact that he would be taken away from his family, his home and the support that he desperately needs here is a disproportionate response to his alleged offending behaviour, because he could be tried here.' The consequences of extraditing him would be 'extreme'. The QC said there was a 'virtual certainty' that there would be a serious deterioration in Mr Love's mental condition if he was sent to the US. He argued that it would be 'unjust and oppressive' to extradite him because of his severe mental disorders.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made important enhancement in biometric and computer vision applications such as face image retrieval [5, 31, 29, 36] , attribute prediction [32, 28] and machine learning applications such as Generative Adverse rial Network (GAN) [9, 14] and semi-supervised learning [13, 23, 12, 27, 20] . In spite of this improvement, creating a deep architecture to learn several tasks simultaneously while enhancing their accuracy by sharing the learning parameters is an ongoing problem. Providing privileged data (i.e. auxiliary data) such as facial attributes to CNN based architecture to recognize face images is a costly or tedious task; or the privileged data may not be available during the testing step. Despite the potential advantages of using auxiliary data, these problems have diminished the popularity and ease of use of multimodality models in face recognition. In this study, we use facial attributes as a soft modality to enhance face recognition. We also indicate that when a deep CNN model is trained to recognize face images, the model indirectly learns the facial attributes as well. Specifically, the two modalities enhance the overall prediction performance when they are trained simultaneously. We show that some auxiliary information provided from identity facial attributes such as gender, nose shape, lips shapes, race can be incorporated with each other and then alongside the facial features, they can assist the CNN to better perform face recognition task. Moreover, it has been shown that variations to illumination, noise, occlusion, and pose confound the identification of a face. However, some facial attributes, stand as more invariant semantic features from which face recognition, verification and many other applications such as zero-shot learning and user annoyance prediction can benefit [26, 1, 6] . In spites of significant enhancements in face verification task, it is still a challenging task in biometrics. Some methods which use facial attributes are considerable [8] ; to cancel out aging variation of face images, Gong et al [8] introduce an age invariant face recognition algorithm; this method leverages a probabilistic model with two latent factors to separate aging variations from person specific features. Wen et al [34] use a latent identity factor to guide CNN learning parameters; the model extracts age invariant deep face features by learning latent identity and CNN parameters jointly. Yandong et al [35] propose a deep CNN based model with a trainable and smart supervision signal called center loss which finds a center for deep features of each class. The center loss penalizes the feature if it is far from its corresponding class center. The method trains softmax and center losses jointly to dispense inter-class samples and compact intra-class samples. Facial attributes are invariant and robust visual features that can be recognized from the face images straightly [33] . Attribute recognition algorithm are essentially categorized to local and global methods. Local methods include three stages; in the first step, these methods detect different parts arXiv:1909.13126v2 [cs.CV] 11 Aug 2021 of an object, in the second step, they extract features from each part. In the third step, these features are concatenated for training a classifier [18, 3, 7, 2, 22, 37] . For instance, The work presented in [18] performs based on extracting hand-crafted features from ten parts of the parts. Zhang et al [37] extract poselets which aligns human body parts to recognize human body attributes. This algorithm works inefficiently if object localization and alignment is not performed properly. Moreover, local methods do not perform well if there exist unconstrained face images with complex variations in the image. This is because, this factor causes face localization and alignment challenging. Global methods, however, extract features from entire image part of the image ignoring object parts. It is worth mentioning that attribute prediction has been also enhanced in the recent years. For example, Bourdev et al [4] introduce a part-based attribute prediction algorithm deploying semantic segmentation to transfer localization information to the facial attribute prediction task. In the other case, Liu et al [21] employs two cascaded CNNs; the first one, is used for face localization, while the second one, ANet, is used for attribute description. Moreover, Zhong et al [38] first localize images and then use an off-the-shelf architecture created for face recognition to introduce the facial attributes at different levels of a CNN model. He et al [10] introduce a multi-task architecture to predict relative facial attributes. This model applies a CNN model to learn local context and global style information from the intermediate convolution layers and fully connected layers, accordingly. In this work, we propose a model guiding CNN parameters to learn face attributes while simultaneously being trained on the objective of face recognition. We show jointly learning certain facial attributes increases the network's face recognition accuracy. Moreover, we observe that the resultant jointly-trained network is a more capable face attribute classifier than one trained on face attributes alone. The framework is constructed from two cascaded networks which communicate information together by sharing their learning parameters in the model. Facial attributes are extra information which compact samples of a class in a discriminate feature space if they are used to describe input data. For example, assume a scenario where it is difficult to recognize the individuals in two face images. If a classifier is trained to utilize the fact that one individual is a male and the other is female, the dimension of gender in the input data becomes a potentially discriminating feature. The parameters shared in the model are trained by modified AdaMax optimizer. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: we describe our model in the 'Proposed model' section, how we train the model parameters using the modified AdaMax optimizer in 'Training model', and finally results and concluding remarks in 'Experiments' and 'Conclusion'. QUERY: Can you generate a 1232-word summary for the previous text?", "completion": "We introduce a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture to classify facial attributes and recognize face images simultaneously via a shared learning paradigm to improve the accuracy for facial attribute prediction and face recognition performance. In this method, we use facial attributes as an auxiliary source of information to assist CNN features extracted from the face images to improve the face recognition performance. Specifically, we use a shared CNN architecture that jointly predicts facial attributes and recognize face images simultaneously via a shared learning parameters, and then we use facial attribute features an an auxiliary source of information concatenated by face features to increase the discrimination of the CNN for face recognition. This process assists the CNN classifier to better recognize face images. The experimental results show that our model increases both the face recognition and facial attribute prediction performance, especially for the identity attributes such as gender and race. We evaluated our method on several standard datasets labeled by identities and face attributes and the results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art face recognition models."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: A father who was famously 'divorced' by his son for killing the boy's mother is now demanding a new trial in her murder, claiming he had mental health issues that were overlooked when he was first jailed. Daniel Holland was put behind bars in 2001 for the 1998 murder of his estranged wife Elizabeth at her home in Quincy, Massachusetts. He shot her eight times in the stomach and chest and bludgeoned her over the head with the butt of his 0.22 calibre rifle. The couple's eight-year-old son Patrick found her body in a pool of blood hours later. Patrick divorced his father in 2004, having him legally stripped of his parental rights, and was later adopted by friends of his mother. Now 51, Daniel, who is serving life without parole for the murder, is demanding a new trial claiming his lawyers should have argued mental impairment on his behalf. He is appealing to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts after being turned down by a local judge who denied his request for a retrial. Holland's new lawyer claims his first legal team did not properly pursue a mental impairment defense despite their argument at trial that he not be held criminally responsible for Elizabeth's death. They said his chronic abuse of drugs and alcohol had damaged his mental health and Holland himself testified that on the day of his wife's death he had drunk, smoked crack cocaine and marijuana.He told the court he had no memory of being at her home or of killing her. But Kevin Nixon, his new lawyer, says not enough was done to prove his mental incapacity. 'The evidence pointing to a mitigating defense of mental impairment was never investigated or developed by trial counsel, Nixon wrote in a legal brief filed with the Supreme Judicial Court. 'The defense (that) was presented was limited and inadequate and, given the evidence that was available to the defense, inexplicable.' It is not what specifically Nixon feels was not adequately pursued in court. He was not available for comment on Thursday morning when contacted. Prosecutors proved that Holland had bought the rifle used in her death and several rounds of ammunition a month before she died. They say Hollands' latest bid for freedom is another vain attempt to get away with the killing. He unsuccessfully attempted to sue his attorneys in 2011 claiming he was not given sound enough advice.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.

King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War: picture by Harry Payne The previous battle of the Hundred Years War is the Battle of Poitiers The next battle in the British Battles series is the Battle of Flodden War: Hundred Years War. Date of the Battle of Agincourt: 25th October 1415. Place of the Battle of Agincourt: Northern France Combatants at the Battle of Agincourt: An English and Welsh army against a French army. Commanders at the Battle of Agincourt: King Henry V of England against the Constable of France, Charles dAlbret, Comte de Dreux. Size of the armies at the Battle of Agincourt: The English army landed in France and besieged the port town of Harfleur some 30,000 strong. The siege took its toll, many in the army dying of disease, and a strong garrison had to be left to defend the captured port. At the Battle of Agincourt Henrys army was probably around 5,000 knights, men-at-arms and archers. Estimates of the size of the French army vary widely, from 30,000 to as high as 100,000. The attack by Henry Vs army on Harfleur before the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War Uniforms, arms and equipment at the Battle of Agincourt: Knights wore steel plate armour of greater thickness and sophistication than at Crey with visored helmets. Two-handed swords were coming into vogue as the battle weapon of the gentry. Otherwise weapons remained the lance, shield, sword, various forms of mace or club and dagger. Each knight wore his coat of arms on his surcoat and shield. King Henry V prays with his army before the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War: click here to buy this picture The English and Welsh archers carried a more powerful bow than their fathers and grandfathers under Edward III and the Black Prince. Armour piercing arrow heads made this weapon more deadly than its predecessor, stocks of thousands of arrows being built up in the Tower of London in preparation for war. For hand-to-hand combat the archers carried swords, daggers, hatchets and war hammers. They wore jackets and loose hose; although many were rendered bare foot by the time of the battle from the long harrowing march from Harfleur. Archers headgear was a skull cap either of boiled leather or wickerwork ribbed with a steel frame. It is claimed that many of the archers stripped off their upper garments for the battle to ease the use of their bows. King Henry wore a polished and plumed bascinet helmet for the battle, surmounted by a gold crown. His surcoat was emblazoned with the arms of England and France. Winner of the Battle of Agincourt: King Henry V of England won a decisive victory in the battle. Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War: map by John Fawkes Account of the Battle of Agincourt: On his accession to the throne of England in April 1413 Henry V resolved to revive the war against France and press his claim to the French throne. Fitful negotiations between the two countries resumed, in which Henry made unacceptable demands that the French emissaries rejected with increasing alarm. All the while England prepared for war. Shakespeare imaginatively incorporated into his portrayal of these negotiations a gift from the French Dauphin of a barrel of tennis balls that Henry threatened to turn into cannon shot. Over the winter of 1414 to 1415 the King ordered his officers to commandeer shipping to transport his army, assembling at Southampton, across the Channel. In August 1415 Henrys army landed at Harfleur and began the siege of the town. Harfleur finally surrendered on 22nd September 1415, no French army having appeared to relieve it. Henry now faced a dilemma. The late departure of the army from England and the unexpectedly stubborn resistance of the Harfleur garrison left little of the campaigning season. Large forces were assembling round him; the French barons putting aside their fractious quarrelling to confront this foreign invasion; even Duke John of Burgundy sending a detachment to the main French army. Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War: picture by Henri Duplay: click here to buy this picture Henry assembled his council and informed it that he intended to march from Harfleur to Calais, ignoring his councillors misgivings at this foolhardy and apparently pointless scheme: Henry could go to Calais by sea with impunity. He had no need to risk his army by marching across the front of powerful French forces and hazarding the crossings of the Seine and the Somme Rivers (with all the difficulties Edward III had encountered before Crey). King Henry V of England, the victor of Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War Henry sent a messenger by sea to Calais ordering the Governor of the town, Sir William Bardolph, to march to the crossing point in the estuary of the Somme that Edward III had used in 1346 and hold it open for Henrys army. On 8th October 1415 the English army marched out of Harfleur on its 100 mile journey to Calais. At the Somme estuary there were no sign of Bardolph and in his place a French force barred the crossing. The French were gathering all around Henry, contingents guarding the bridges and fords along the Somme for a considerable distance. Henry marched south east up the left bank of the river, a French force keeping pace and opposing any attempt to cross. Finally the English army was able to outstrip the shadowing Frenchmen by cutting straight across a bow in the river, crossing and resuming the march north east towards Calais. In the face of the gathering French armies Henry ordered his archers to cut sharpened staves to form a barrier against mounted attack. On 24th October 1415 the English army, led by a screen of scouts, marched through the Picardy town of Frvent, now within 30 miles of Calais and safety. As the army entered the valley beyond the town, the scouts came riding back at speed with the news that an immense army blocked the road. The French had managed to march past the English and cut across their route during the delay on the Somme. A medieval illustration of the Battle of Agincourt: the opposing Royal Standards are displayed: England on the right; France on the left. The English Royal Standards incorporates the Lilies of France to show the claim of the Kings of England to the French throne: click here to buy this picture A Welsh man-at-arms, David Gambe, on being questioned by King Henry as to the size of the French army, said There are enough to kill, enough to capture and enough to run away. Beyond the village of Maisoncelles the French came into sight, a mass of knights and men-at-arms spilling across the valley from the East. Seeing that he could not pass without giving battle Henry ordered his army to encamp and prepare to fight the next day. That evening an air of resignation hung over the English, caused by the heavy rain that began to fall and the enormous French camp two miles up the road, marked in the dark by myriads of twinkling fires, laughter and music: the French had little doubt but that they would prevail the next day. During the night Henry made his way around his army giving words of encouragement; again a dramatic episode made much of by Shakespeare. The next morning, 25th October 1415, the feast of St Crispin and a public holiday in England, the English army marched out of Maisoncelles, taking up position across the road to Calais in three divisions of knights and men-at-arms; commanded by Lord Camoys on the right, the Duke of York in the centre and Sir Thomas Erpingham on the left. The Archers formed wedged divisions along the front. Further down the road the French army was forming for battle. The Constable of France led the first French line. The Dukes of Bar and dAlenon led the second and the Counts of Merle and Falconberg led the third. In front of the English position two forests approached the road from each side, leaving an area of muddy plough between them, insufficient for the French army to deploy with ease when every French knight of significance wished to be in the front with his retinue; the mass of knights and men-at-arms too compacted and unwieldy to manoeuvre or control. The English soldiers knelt down before the battle commenced and kissed the ground as a symbol that they might be returning to the earth before the day was over. Henrys men waited for the French to begin the attack but there was no movement in the opposing army. It may be that there was inadequate overall command and no central decision made when to commence the assault or it may be that the French were waiting for further contingents to arrive and take their station. The armies clash at the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War Finally Henry, urged to begin the battle by his commanders, gave the command Forward banners and the army advanced with trumpets blaring. Once in arrow range of the French Henry gave the command to halt and the divisions closed up, the archers setting their pointed staves in the ground forming a fence leaning outwards towards the French. Now within the confines of the two woods Henry directed parties of archers and men-at-arms to move through the trees nearer to the French. Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War On the kings signal the English archers opened a devastating fire on the compact mass of French knights and men-at-arms. After the initial shock the front line of the French army moved forward to the charge. In the narrow confines of the muddy rain soaked ploughland the charge quickly reduced to a stumbling walk, impeded by the floundering men and horses shot down by the archers, the arrow storm from the front compounded by the fire of the English concealed in the woods on the flanks. The battle raged over the stake fence along the English line, the archers abandoning their bows and joining the knights and men-at-arms in hand to hand combat with the French cavalry, much of it now dismounted; the soldiers from the woods attacking on the flanks. Within two hours of the battle beginning it was clear that the English had won. While individual French soldiers fought hard, it was from desperation as the English knights, men-at-arms and archers overwhelmed the struggling mass, taking as prisoner those who might be worth a ransom and killing the rest. King Henry V and the Duke DAlenon at the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War The Duke DAlenon bringing up his division to assist the first line was overcome and about to surrender to Henry himself when he was struck dead. The Constable of France, Charles DAlbret, was killed with numbers of other prominent French nobles, the Dukes dOrleans and de Brabant among them. The French third line hovered on the edge of the field uncertain whether to take the risk of joining the fight until Henry sent a herald to order them off the battlefield on pain of receiving no quarter. The third line melted away.

The main battle was finished by midday, the remnants of the French army streaming away from the battlefield while the English rounded up their prisoners. At this point a small French force led by local nobles, Isambart dAgincourt and Robert de Bournonville, used their local knowledge to march around the forests and fall on the English baggage at Maisoncelles. Fearing a renewal of the battle with an attack on his rear Henry ordered the French prisoners put to the sword, enforcing this order with the threat of hanging, and reformed his army to face the threat. The French raiders were quickly repelled but not before many of the prisoners were killed, an incident that marred the English victory by depriving the soldiers of the considerable sums they could have raised through ransom. The final act of the battle was to disperse the remnants of the third line and ransack the French camp; before resuming the march to Calais, previously so difficult, now triumphantly easy. The French are overwhelmed at the Battle of Agincourt on 25th October 1415 in the Hundred Years War Casualties at the Battle of Agincourt: It is believed that some 8,000 Frenchmen died in the battle, including many of the most senior nobles of France. English losses are thought to have been in the hundreds. The Duke of York died in the battle as did the Earl of Suffolk, whose father had died in the siege of Harfleur the month before. Follow-up to the Battle of Agincourt: King Henry continued his march to Calais and returned to England for the celebrations to mark the victory at Agincourt. His army stayed at Calais but it was too late in the season for further campaigning. Harfleur became an English town for the time being. The French King Charles descended into a bout of insanity on hearing the terrible news of the defeat and Frances losses at Agincourt.

After the battle Henry V entertained his senior commanders to dinner, waited on by captured French knights. During the battle an English knight, Sir Piers Legge of Lyme Hall, lay wounded in the mud while his mastiff dog fought off the French men-at-arms. Only when Sir Piers squire and servants came up after the battle would the mastiff allow anyone to approach his master. Sir Piers did not survive his wounds, but the dog returned to Lyme Hall and is reputed to have sired the English Mastiff breed. It was believed among the English archers during the Hundred Years War that the French intended to cut off the first and second right hand fingers of every captured archer to prevent him from again using a bow. The archers raised those two fingers to the advancing French as a gesture of defiance.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Modern measurement technologies provide the means to measure high density spatial and geometric data in three-dimensional (3D) coordinate systems, referred to as point clouds. Point cloud data analysis has broad applications in advanced manufacturing and metrology for measuring dimensional accuracy and shape analysis, in geographic information systems (GIS) for digital elevation modeling and analysis of terrains, in computer graphics for shape reconstruction, and in medical imaging for volumetric measurement to name a few. The role of point cloud data in manufacturing is now more important than ever, particularly in the field of smart and additive manufacturing processes, where products with complex shape and geometry are manufactured with the help of advanced technologies (Gibson et al., 2010) . In these processes, the dimensional and geometric accuracy of manufactured parts are measured in the form of point clouds using modern sensing devices, including touch-probe coordinate measuring machines (CMM) and optical systems, such as laser scanners. Modeling the relationship of the dimensional accuracy, encapsulated in point clouds, with process parameters and machine settings is vital for variation reduction and process optimization. As an example, consider a turning process where the surface geometry of manufactured parts is affected by two process variables; namely cutting speed and cutting depth. Figure 1 shows nine point-cloud samples of cylindrical parts produced with different combinations of the cutting speed and cutting depth. Each point-cloud sample represents the dimensional deviation of a point from the corresponding nominal value. The main goal of this paper is to propose novel tensor regression methods to quantify the relationship between structured point clouds and scalar predictors. In this paper, we focus on a class of point clouds where the measurements are taken on a pre-specified grid. We refer to this as structured point-cloud, commonly found in dimensional metrology (Pieraccini et al., 2001; Colosimo et al., 2010) . The widely used metrology system to acquire a structured point-cloud is a conventional CMM, where points can be sampled one by one (acquisition in a single point mode). In such systems, the localization of the points on a surface can be accurately controlled by the operator. Due to the optimal traceability of CMMs, high accuracy and precision are obtained, making a CMM one of the most important metrology systems in manufacturing. Point-cloud data representation and analysis for surface reconstruction have been extensively discussed in the literature. Point clouds are often converted to polygon or triangle mesh models (Baumgart, 1975) , to NURBS surface models (Rogers, 2000) , or to CAD models by means of surface reconstruction techniques, such as Delaunay triangulation (Shewchuk, 1996) , alpha shapes (Edelsbrunner and Mcke, 1994) , and ball pivoting (Bernardini et al., 1999) . Although these techniques are effective in providing a compact representation of point clouds, they are not capable of modeling the relationship between point clouds and some independent variables. In the area of process improvement, the literature on modeling and analysis of point clouds can be classified into two general categories : (i) process monitoring and (ii) process modeling and optimization approaches. Research in the process monitoring category mainly focuses on finding unusual patterns in the point cloud to detect out-of-control states and corresponding assignable causes, e.g., combining parametric regression with univariate and multivariate control charts for quantifying 3D surfaces with spatially correlated noises. However, these models assume that a parametric model exists for 3D point clouds, which may not be true for surfaces with complex shapes. To address this challenge, Wells et al. (2013) proposed to use Q-Q plots to transform the high-dimensional point cloud monitoring into a linear profile monitoring problem. This approach, however, fails to capture the spatial information of the data as it reduces a 3D point cloud to a Q-Q plot. Colosimo et al. (2014) applied the Gaussian process to model and monitor 3D surfaces with spatial correlation. However, applying Gaussian process models can be inefficient for high-dimensional data such as those in our application. The main This model is then used to find the optimal control settings to minimize the dimensional and geometric deviations of produced parts from nominal values. Despite the importance of the topic, little research can be found in this area. Colosimo and Pacella (2011) proposed a two-step approach where first a high-dimensional point cloud is reduced to a set of features using complex Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then, the multivariate ANOVA is applied to the extracted features to test the effect of a set of scalar factors on the features mean. The main issue of the two-step approach is that the dimension reduction and modeling/test steps are carried out separately. Hence, the relationship of scalar factors with point cloud is not considered in the dimension reduction step. Because of its grid structure, a structured point cloud can be compactly represented in a multidimensional array also known as a tensor. Therefore, modeling the structured point cloud as a function of some controllable factors can be considered as a tensor regression problem. The objective of this paper is to develop a tensor regression framework to model a tensor response as a function of some scalar predictors and use this model for prediction and process optimization. The main challenge in achieving this objective is the high dimensionality resulting in a large number of parameters to be estimated. To achieve this, we take the advantage of the fact that the essential information of highdimensional point cloud data lies in a low-dimensional space and we use low-dimensional basis to significantly reduce the dimensionality and the number of models parameters. To select appropriate bases, we introduce two approaches, namely One-step Tensor Decomposition Regression (OTDR) and Regularized Tensor Regression (RTR). OTDR is a data-driven approach, where the basis and coefficients are learned automatically from the tensor regression objective function. In RTR, we project the response tensor on a set of predefined basis such as Splines with roughness penalization to control the smoothness of the estimated tensor response. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief literature review on functional and tensor regression models. Section 3 provides an overview of the basic tensor notations and multilinear algebra operations. Section 4 first introduces the general regression framework for tensor response data and then elaborates the two approaches for basis selection, i.e., OTDR and RTR. Section 5 validates the proposed methodology by using simulated data with two different types of structured point clouds. In this section, the performance of the proposed method is compared with existing two-step methods in terms of the estimation accuracy and computational time. In Section 6, we illustrate a case study for process modeling and optimization in a turning process. Finally, we conclude the paper with a short discussion and an outline of future work in Section 7.

In this paper, we utilize multilinear algebra techniques and propose a set of tensor regression approaches to model the variational patterns of point clouds and to link them to process variables.

{"prompt": "TEXT: The management of risks, and especially the management of credit risk is one of the core challenges of financial institutions. Advances in technology have enabled lenders to reduce lending risk by evaluating a profusion of customer data. Using statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques, the available data is analyzed and boiled down to a single quality measure, known as a credit score. Complex machine learning models have been proven very effective in providing a high predictive accuracy in assessing the credit risk of customers. However, these new and advanced techniques lack the transparency which is necessary to understand how and why a certain borrower is granted a loan or not. Namely, since these models are created directly from data by an algorithm it is often very difficult to trace back the steps the algorithm took to arrive at its decision. Since these models can lack transparency, in some cases significantly, model developers can only interpret the predictions by guessing what the models might have learned. According to Ribeiro et al. (2016) when we directly use machine learning classifiers as tools for decision making, a vital concern arises: if the users do not trust the model or its predictions, they will not use it. In this context, it is important to differentiate between two different (but related) definitions of trust ( [1] ):  trusting a prediction, i.e. whether a user trusts an individual prediction sufficiently to take some action based on it,  trusting a model, i.e. whether the user trusts a model to behave in reasonable ways if deployed. This explainability of credit decisions is also explicitly demanded by regulators. A report by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BAFIN ( [2] ), from 2018 states that they will not accept any \"black box excuses\", indicating further that it will be the responsibility of the supervised entity to ensure that any AI-based decisions can be explained to 3rd parties. Furthermore, this issue of explainability is particularly relevant for finance service providers operating in Europe as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies across all European Union Member States and Articles 13-15 of this regulation supports a right to an explanation. Specifically, when an individual is subject to a decision based solely on automated processing that significantly affects that individual, the GDPR enables that user the right to meaningful information about the logic involved in the decision taken. This being said, it is clear that having explanations supporting the outputs of a model is crucial and improvements in the understanding of the system can lead to a significant increase in the adoption of innovative methodologies in financial applications. To this end, the concept of eXplainable AI (XAI) emerged introducing a suite of machine learning (ML) techniques that produce models that offer an acceptable trade-off between explainability as well as predictive utility and enables humans to understand, trust and manage the emerging generations of AI models. Among the emerging techniques, two frameworks have been widely recognized as the state-of-the-art in machine learning explainability and those are:  the LIME framework, introduced by Ribeiro et al. in 2016 ( [1] )  SHAP values, introduced by Lundberg et al. in 2017 ( [5] ). Both methods shed light on the inner workings of black box models, thereby explaining the reasoning behind the predictions. Interpretability is especially important in finance applications where the reliance of the model on the correct features must be guaranteed. Yet, despite the high relevance of this topic in AI's applications in finance, the literature focusing on this specific context has been very limited with only a few exceptions. Bussman et al. (2020) ( [3] ) propose a XAI model for fintech risk management based on Shapley values where the authors aim to explain loan decisions using a sample of 15,000 SME companies. The authors confirm the usefulness of Shapley values in increasing the transparency of complex ML models applied to credit risk but they do not tackle some of the main technical challenges in using this approach on larger data sets, which would be the more natural state for finance service providers. The most interesting precedent is perhaps the research by Miller et al. (2020) ( [4] ) where the authors aim to assess the predictive utility of several well-known ML models in the context of P2P lending platforms' credit scoring. Furthermore, the authors apply the Shapley method to provide explainability to the prediction also in view of a much larger feature space. Although this study is one of the few that aims to test the practicality of using emerging XAI techniques in the financial context, it too implements only one of the two main frameworks. The main objective of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the utility of both SHAP and LIME frameworks in the context of credit risk management. We further outline the practical hurdles in applying these techniques in financial applications as well as propose solutions to the challenges faced. QUERY: What is the previous article about? Please summarize in about 1627 words.", "completion": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created the single biggest technology revolution the world has ever seen. For the finance sector, it provides great opportunities to enhance customer experience, democratize financial services, ensure consumer protection and significantly improve risk management. While it is easier than ever to run state-of-the-art machine learning models, designing and implementing systems that support real-world finance applications have been challenging. In large part because they lack transparency and explainability which are important factors in establishing reliable technology and the research on this topic with a specific focus on applications in credit risk management. In this paper, we implement two advanced post-hoc model agnostic explainability techniques called Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to machine learning (ML)-based credit scoring models applied to the open-access data set offered by the US-based P2P Lending Platform, Lending Club. Specifically, we use LIME to explain instances locally and SHAP to get both local and global explanations. We discuss the results in detail and present multiple comparison scenarios by using various kernels available for explaining graphs generated using SHAP values. We also discuss the practical challenges associated with the implementation of these state-of-art eXplainabale AI (XAI) methods and document them for future reference. We have made an effort to document every technical aspect of this research, while at the same time providing a general summary of the conclusions."}
{"prompt": "TEXT: The twenty-four horses dash around a racetrack. The thunder of their hooves rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history. The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions. Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory. Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically. Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners. The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment. The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class. They come dressed in their finest to enjoy the event in comfort. But anyway it's all about the race--the effort of horses and riders, the suspense and the thrill of victory. QUERY: What can be learned about the horses in the Melbourne Cup? 'They are all winners of a certain race', 'They are raised and trained by joint effort', 'They are chosen from ordinary horses' or 'Their fates are determined by their trainers'?", "completion": "They are raised and trained by joint effort."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: Whitney Bromberg Hawkings, 43, set up flower company Flowerbx three years ago. She lives in London with her husband and three children. I worked for designer Tom Ford for 19 years. I was hired to be his PA straight out of school, and worked my way up to become senior vice-president of communications. Tom always said everyone needs a ten-year plan. When I turned 40 I knew I didnt want to be seating fashion editors at fashion shows for the next decade, being bawled out by 26-year-olds because they werent on the front row! At the time, I was pregnant with my third child and buying groceries from Ocado, clothes from Net-a-Porter and everything else from Amazon. Flowers were the one thing I couldnt buy in an elegant, consistent way online. When I sent them on behalf of Tom, I was always asking for single-stem bunches  no babys breath, no mixed bunches. But bouquets of one type of flower were hard to find and expensive. I realised there could be a totally different way to buy flowers. A traditional florist sells you an off-the-shelf bouquet or whatever they have bought from the flower market, which will have sat around for a few days. My idea was to go straight to the grower with the customers order. So, if you want only red lilies, you can have really fresh red lilies, without the markup of the market and florist. So, at evenings and weekends I contacted growers and found drivers and a warehouse. On launch day  with a baby on my lap  I sent ten bouquets as a test to friends, one of whom was Graham Norton. He tweeted it, and fashion editors Instagrammed it. The single-stemmed idea made us a big hit on social media, driving business. I knew I had to leave Tom  the hardest break-up of my life. Things havent been all plain sailing. We were developing our website when the firm went bankrupt, taking our money with them. However, that gave me the time to engineer the perfect flower boxes, so expansion was less painful. My young kids muck in, too. On weekends, they help load the vans and they love it. My next decade, it turns out, will be hardest in terms of work, but the most exciting.

{"prompt": "TEXT: This is the shocking moment a bonnet is ripped off the front of a car travelling at 80mph and flies through the air on the M1. The carriageway was showered with debris after the VW Golf's bonnet 'exploded' and soared above traffic. Paul Troth, who was driving behind, had to swerve as pieces of metal and plastic bounced off the road. Mr Troth, from Rugby, Warwickshire, captured the incident while he was driving near Nottingham. The 48-year-old explained: 'Driving down the M1 this guy in the VW Golf forgot to close his bonnet, it could have been a lot worse if there were more traffic on the road.' The video shows Mr Troth cruising on the M1 at 75mph, when theGolf appears overtakes him.

{"prompt": "TEXT: We propose a novel hierarchical approach for text-to-image synthesis by inferring semantic layout. Instead of learning a direct mapping from text to image, our algorithm decomposes the generation process into multiple steps, in which it first constructs a semantic layout from the text by the layout generator and converts the layout to an image by the image generator. The proposed layout generator progressively constructs a semantic layout in a coarse-to-fine manner by generating object bounding boxes and refining each box by estimating object shapes inside the box. The image generator synthesizes an image conditioned on the inferred semantic layout, which provides a useful semantic structure of an image matching with the text description. Our model not only generates semantically more meaningful images, but also allows automatic annotation of generated images and user-controlled generation process by modifying the generated scene layout. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed model on challenging MS-COCO dataset and show that the model can substantially improve the image quality, interpretability of output and semantic alignment to input text over existing approaches.

Yulia, 33, and Stepan Vikeev, 30 who reportedly has links to Russian intelligence services lived together for two years before she flew to Britain to see her father Sergei, the former spy. The source said:'She is confused but thinks she was collateral damage in the attack.She can't see him or speak to him to discuss matters. She's upset and fearful she may never see him again.' Yulia's heartbreak follows the horror of the attack on her and her father with the nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury on March 4th. But it has been claimed that Yulia was targeted because her boyfriend's family were opposed to their marriage. She and her father are said to have been poisoned in a 'domestic' dispute and the disappearance offianc Vikeev has added to the mystery. His mother Tatiana Vikeeva, 61, reported to have links to the Russian secret services, refused to give her blessing to the engagement and said that she did not want her son to wed the 'daughter of a traitor'. Former spy Sergei Skripal's niece Viktoria has revealed that her cousin's relationship with Vikeev had been opposed by his family and the attack in Salisbury was a result.

The changes - made shortly before Tuesday's session began - spreads the 24 hours given to each side to make their case to the Senate over three days instead of the two McConnell originally proposed. That would keep arguments from going until 1 a.m., when viewership would be low. Instead they would end in the evening - likely around 9 p.m. Democrats had objected to the original proposal, chargingthe Senate Republican Leader of trying to help the president with a coverup. 'It appears Leader McConnell decided to go along with the president's desire to cover up his wrongdoing,' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Tuesday before the trial began. But while McConnell can afford to lose Democratic support, he can't afford to lose any of his Republican senators as his party only has a three-vote majority. And thus the changes were made. And they came so quickly they were simply hand written on the original resolution instead of a fresh copy being submitted. Collins could be a throne in McConnell's side again. She released a statement Tuesday evening indicating she would support a Democratic effort later in the trial to subpoena additional witnesses. She said she would 'likely' support such a move after each side made opening arguments. 'As I said last week, while I need to hear the case argued and the questions answered, I anticipate that I would conclude that having additional information would be helpful. It is likely that I would support a motion to subpoena witnesses at that point in the trial just as I did in 1999,' Collins said. McConnell's new rules resolution, proposed by the Senate Republican Leader on Tuesday, also automatically enters the House evidence against the president into the Senate record instead of the senators having to vote on making that happen. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio was another lawmaker who raised concerns about McConnell's original resolution, CNN reported."}
{"prompt": "TEXT: K-means clustering is widely used for its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, one of the major practical problems of k-means is that the algorithm itself cannot determine the optimal number of clusters. There have been a few proposals as to possible approaches for this problem. For example, regularized k-means (Sun et al., 2012) proposed a regularization term for the k-means algorithm, and modified the algorithm to find a consistent number of clusters. The X-means algorithms (Pelleg and Moore, 2000) is also known as an algorithm to stop the iteration of the clustering using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as a criterion. The results and algorithms of these methods are accurate when the probabilistic distribution of the dataset can be assumed to be some variation of a Gaussian. However, whether this assumption holds for empirical data is generally unclear. To offer a practical criterion to determine the number of clustering in empirical studies where the nature of the distribution is unknown, we propose the use of compression ratio as a simple criterion to determine the optimal number of clusters without changing the algorithm of k-means. Here, we consider the k-means algorithm as data compression, and evaluate the compression ratio using description length of the dataset, following the idea of minimum description length (MDL). The idea is that the optimal number of clusters should provide the most efficient compression ratio. In this paper, we discuss two types of description length, each of which gives rise to a definition of compression ratio. Furthermore, the approach to compute description length also offers a systematic way to examine whether clustering was left redundancy in data. That is to say, if further compression is possible after the first-level k-means clustering, the data size after the second compression should be even smaller. However, such cases indicate that redundancy is present in the first-stage k-means clustering, which is violates the assumption of k-means that there is no hierarchical structure in the dataset. Thus, the description length approach also offers a way to reveal potential hierarchical structure in the dataset. To observe the behavior of the compression ratio and demonstrate the usability of our criteria in practice, we tested the criteria with synthetic and empirical brain MRI data. For the MRI data, we applied the proposed criteria to a brain parcellation problem using structural MRI data. Previously, Glasser et al. (2016) showed a parcellation of human cerebral cortex using both the structural MRI and functional MRI data. Here, we focus on the structural MRI dataset to determine the number of clusters (i.e. brain regions) based on interindividual differences in the local volumetric measure of gray matter (Kanai & Rees, 2011) . Since the main focus of the current paper is to present the criteria to determine the number of clusters in k-means, we will not discuss neurobiological implications of the results in details. QUERY: Summarize the preceding text in your own words.", "completion": "We present an asymptotic criterion to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means. We consider k-means as data compression, and propose to adopt the number of clusters that minimizes the estimated description length after compression. Here we report two types of compression ratio based on two ways to quantify the description length of data after compression. This approach further offers a way to evaluate whether clusters obtained with k-means have a hierarchical structure by examining whether multi-stage compression can further reduce the description length. We applied our criteria to determine the number of clusters to synthetic data and empirical neuroimaging data to observe the behavior of the criteria across different types of data set and suitability of the two types of criteria for different datasets. We found that our method can offer reasonable clustering results that are useful for dimension reduction. While our numerical results revealed dependency of our criteria on the various aspects of dataset such as the dimensionality, the description length approach proposed here provides a useful guidance to determine the number of clusters in a principled manner when underlying properties of the data are unknown and only inferred from observation of data."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: PAI NAA by Dorothy Thatcher and Robert Cross (Monsoon Books 8.99) Sixty million people died in World War II, so when we read a forgotten story about one individuals personal tragedy, we should hardly be surprised. Here is the story of Vin Baker and his sister Nona (told by Nona and two ghostwriters), who together hid for more than three years in the Malayan jungle during the conflict. Vin, the benign manager of a vast tin mine in Malaya in the Thirties, sees his whole world crumble before his eyes after the Japanese invade in 1941, and this shocking, gripping story takes us with utmost clarity through the process by which a successful, optimistic man is reduced by war to a depressive, shaking, dysentery-ridden skeleton. It all starts in Dunstable, of all places. Nona (Nin) is the daughter of the rector of Dunstable. Nin casually tells us that her sister died at boarding school and two brothers died in World War I, so this is a person braced for tragedy. But when Nin accepts her mothers suggestion that she travel to Malaya in 1935 to run the household for her adored brother Vin, she can have no idea of the consequences of this merry plan. Malaya seems dazzlingly exotic after Dunstable. Vin has 5,000 employees working under him. Nin, the perfect spinster younger sister, devotes her life to making his palatial household run smoothly. In the evenings, she plays the grand piano to soothe him after a hard days work. Returning to Malaya from six months leave in England in 1937, they sense trouble is looming. But surely the great British Army will defend Singapore and Malaya will be safe from Japanese invasion? Nins crystal-clear recollections take us right back to that sense of optimism and trust  so its all the more shocking when they hear the news in December 1941 that Singapore has fallen to the Japanese. The unthinkable has happened and Vin must do the unthinkable himself: flood his own mine, putting it out of use for the Japanese. The disintegration of his lifes work, Nin calls this act. From that moment, the two of them go into hiding in makeshift huts in the jungle. This book will cure any Kipling-inspired romantic notions about life in the jungle.

{"prompt": "TEXT: Primordial, non-Gaussian perturbations can generate scale-dependent bias in the galaxy distribution. This in turn will modify correlations between galaxy positions and peculiar velocities at late times, since peculiar velocities reflect the underlying matter distribution, whereas galaxies are a biased tracer of the same. We study this effect, and show that non-Gaussianity can be constrained by comparing the observed peculiar velocity field to a model velocity field reconstructed from the galaxy density field assuming linear bias. The amplitude of the spatial correlations in the residual map obtained after subtracting one velocity field from the other is directly proportional to the strength of the primordial non-Gaussianity. We construct the corresponding likelihood function use it to constrain the amplitude of the linear flow $\\beta$ and the amplitude of local non-Gaussianity $f^{\\rm NL}_{\\rm local}$. Applying our method to two observational data sets, the Type-Ia supernovae (A1SN) and Spiral Field \\textit{I}-band (SFI++) catalogues, we obtain constraints on the linear flow parameter consistent with the values derived previously assuming Gaussianity. The marginalised 1-D distribution of $|f^{\\rm NL}_{\\rm local}|$ does not show strong evidence for non-zero $f^{\\rm NL}_{\\rm local}$, and we set 95% upper limits $|f^{\\rm NL}_{\\rm local}|<51.4$ from A1SN and $|f^{\\rm NL}_{\\rm local}|<92.6$ from SFI++.

U.S. District Judge John D. Bates wrote in his opinion late Thursday that so-called 'association health plans' were 'clearly an end-run' around consumer protections required by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. On Wednesday, another federal judge blocked the Trump administration's Medicaid work requirements for low-income people. The plans at issue in Bates' ruling Thursday allow groups of small businesses and sole proprietors to band together to offer lower-cost coverage that doesn't have to include all the benefits required by the ACA, often called 'Obamacare.' They also can be offered across state lines, an attempt to deliver on a major Trump campaign promise. Trump, a Republican, has eagerly talked up the plans, saying they're doing record business by offering 'tremendous health care at very small cost.' But the Labor Department regulation authorizing them only took effect last summer, and they don't seem to have made a major impact on the market. Initial estimates said 3 million to 4 million people eventually would enroll, compared with more than 160 million Americans covered by current employer plans. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who joined other Democratic state officials in suing the Trump administration, said the judge 'saw past the Trump administration's transparent effort to sabotage our health care system and gut these critical consumer protections in the service of its own partisan agenda.' Many state officials see federal insurance regulation of small-business plans as infringing on their own traditional authority. The Trump administration, unable to repeal 'Obamacare' in Congress, has tried to use its rule-making powers to open up a pathway for alternatives. In the case of small-business plans, the administration's regulation granted them similar flexibility on benefits as enjoyed by big companies. Most large employer plans are not subject to state regulations, and the Obama law did not make major changes to them either. But Bates wrote that treating small businesses and sole proprietors similarly to major employers 'creates absurd results.' Bates was nominated to the federal bench by Republican President George W. Bush. His ruling seems to signal limits to how far the Trump administration can advance with its strategy of relying on regulations to transform health care. It wasn't immediately clear how the Trump administration would respond, but officials have said they will keep moving ahead with the president's agenda."}

{"prompt": "TEXT: Microtubules, composed of tubulin, are the major part of the cytoskeleton and are crucial for cell division, migration, trafficking, and signalling (Lodish et al., 2008) . In particular, microtubules play a central role in the process of cell mitosis, which has resulted in microtubule-binding agents (MTAs) acting as effective anticancer agents by inducing mitotic arrest and cell death as cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells (Mukhtar et al., 2014) . Continued study of microtubule responses to MTAs remain paramount due to significant discoveries related to difficulties in the use of MTAs to treat neoplastic cells, such as neuronal toxicity, and drug resistance (Orr et al., 2003) . High-throughput phenotypic screening is a powerful search tool for cancer drug candidates, which applies large-scale sets of compounds to cultured cells with the goal of quan-tifying their effects by measuring changes in cellular phenotypes. High-content screening (HCS) is a type of high-throughput phenotypic screening that uses microscopy to image cellular components and outputs images as measured phenotypes. This is often conducted with fluorescence microscopy, where cellular components are labeled with fluorescent probes and visualized under a microscope. HCS has been applied to identify potential drug candidates for treating cerebral cavernous malformation (Gibson et al., 2015) and inhibiting bacterial growth (Sundaramurthy et al., 2013) . Unbiased HCS requires the ability to capture a large number of images of subcellular outcomes within a reasonable amount of time. For practical reasons, trade-off decisions are made between imaging speed and imaging resolution for HCS-specific experiments (Buchser et al., 2014) . The consequences of such trade-offs are particularly challenging for HCS on microtubule networks for the purposes of drug discovery, as both image quality (i.e., recovering structures of microtubule networks) and speed (i.e., testing many compounds in sequence) are critical in the identification of effective drugs. The wide-field microscope, despite its superior speed, captures out-of-focus fluorescent signals that can greatly mask microtubules. Confocal microscopes are able to dramatically reduce fluorescent signals at the cost of slower image acquisition. In this paper, we propose a computational solution to capitalize on the advantages of both imaging modalities to generate high quality images at sufficiently fast speeds. To computationally enhance the important structural signals of microtubule networks within HCS images, we propose using a generative adversarial networks model approach (Figure 1 ). We begin by training a model using high-resolution images of microtubule networks from low-throughput confocal images, collected from The Human Protein Atlas (Thul et al., 2017) . Using the CycleGAN framework , we demonstrate that the quality of HCS images can be enhanced by training a model to identify important features of microtubule networks from external reference images. With the removal of unwanted fluorescence-associated signals, the microtubule networks can be easily segmented from images using Otsu thresholding (Otsu, 1979) . Finally, we apply this technique to verify whether expected drug effects on the density of microtubule networks can be observed from computationally enhanced HCS images. QUERY: Generate a summary for the text.", "completion": "Given the crucial role of microtubules for cell survival, many researchers have found success using microtubule-targeting agents in the search for effective cancer therapeutics. Understanding microtubule responses to targeted interventions requires that the microtubule network within cells can be consistently observed across a large sample of images. However, fluorescence noise sources captured simultaneously with biological signals while using wide-field microscopes can obfuscate fine microtubule structures. Such requirements are particularly challenging for high-throughput imaging, where researchers must make decisions related to the trade-off between imaging quality and speed. Here, we propose a computational framework to enhance the quality of high-throughput imaging data to achieve fast speed and high quality simultaneously. Using CycleGAN, we learn an image model from low-throughput, high-resolution images to enhance features, such as microtubule networks in high-throughput low-resolution images. We show that CycleGAN is effective in identifying microtubules with 0.93+ AUC-ROC and that these results are robust to different kinds of image noise. We further apply CycleGAN to quantify the changes in microtubule density as a result of the application of drug compounds, and show that the quantified responses correspond well with known drug effects"}
{"prompt": "TEXT: Single image super-resolution (SISR), with the goal of estimating the clean high-resolution (HR) counterpart x of a given low-resolution (LR) image y, is a classical problem with highly academic and practical values [3] . Basically, the relationship between LR and HR images is characterized by the degradation model which defines how the LR image is degraded from an HR image. Empirical and theoretical studies have proven that an accurate degradation model is crucial for the success of SISR [20, 60] . Thus, it is important to first review the degradation model for SISR. In fact, most existing SISR methods are designed under the assumption of certain degradation model. There are two widely-used degradation models. The first one, which is acknowledged as a general degradation model for SISR, is given by y where x  k represents the convolution between blur kernel k and HR image x,  s is a subsequent downsampling operation with scale factor s, and n is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with noise level . Such degradation model has been extensively studied on developing modelbased optimization methods [13, 19] . However, these methods mostly assume a priori known blur kernel which in practice is difficult to estimate. Although several works such as [41, 53] focus on estimating blur kernel, their source codes are unfortunately not publicly available. The second and perhaps the most widely-used one which we refer to as bicubic degradation is formalized as Here, unless otherwise specified,  s instead represents the bicubic downsampler (Matlab default function imresize) with scale factor s. Due to its simplicity, bicubic degradation model has become the benchmark setting to evaluate SISR methods [29, 36] . In particular, it greatly facilities the development of powerful deep neural networks (DNN) for SISR [2] . However, such a simple degradation inevitably gives rise to poor results in many practical scenarios [20, 65] . Nevertheless, little work has been done on extending to more realistic degradation models. Given the above considerations, it is very necessary to address the following two issues: 1) designing an alternative degradation model, and 2) extending existing DNNbased methods for bicubic degradation to the new degradation model so as to exploit the power of DNN. To this end, we first propose a simple yet effective degradation model which assumes the LR image is a bicubicly downsampled, blurred and noisy version of an HR image. Compared to the general degradation model given by Eqn. (1) , the proposed one offers two favorable merits. First, it generalizes the well-studied bicubic degradation model given by Eqn. (2) . Second, it enables us to adopt the available blind deblurring methods to estimate the blur kernel from the given LR image. In order to extend DNN-based SISR methods to the new degradation model, we propose a well-principled deep plug-and-play super-resolution (DPSR) framework which integrates DNN-based super-resolver into a variable splitting based iterative optimization scheme. It turns out that the distortion of blur can be effectively handled in Fourier domain. For this reason, it is possible to deal with arbitrary blur kernels, which is one of the main goals in this paper. Moreover, different from existing plug-and-play framework [13] which generally plugs the off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser as a modular part, the proposed instead achieves the plug-in step by applying any existing DNN-based superresolvers with only a small modification. By far, it is worth emphasizing that we mainly focus on non-blind SISR for arbitrary uniform blur kernels rather than blind SISR for arbitrary non-uniform blur kernels. On the one hand, non-blind SISR is important to blind SISR which generally involves alternatively updating the blur kernel and applying non-blind SISR to update the superresolved image. While some recent works attempt to train DNN to directly estimate the clean image for blind deblurring, their practicability needs further evaluations. On the other hand, although the non-uniform blur kernel tends to be a more realistic assumption, it is too complex and still remains to be a difficult problem for image deblurring [31] . In fact, the arbitrary uniform blur kernel assumption is already a much better choice than the simple bicubic kernel for practical applications. Briefly speaking, our work makes a valuable intermediate step from existing bicubic degradation based SISR to ultimate blind SISR. The contribution of this work is summarized as follows:  A more realistic degradation model than bicubic degradation model for SISR is proposed. It considers arbitrary blur kernels and enables to use existing deblurring methods for blur kernel estimation.  A deep plug-and-play super-resolution framework is proposed to solve SISR with the new degradation model. DPSR is applicable beyond bicubic degradation and can handle LR images with arbitrary blur kernels.  The proposed DPSR is well-principled as the iterative scheme aims to solve the new degradation induced energy function.  The proposed DPSR extends existing plug-and-play framework, showing that the plug-and-play prior for SISR is not limited to Gaussian denoiser. QUERY: Please write a summary of about 1253 words based on the previous article.", "completion": "While deep neural networks (DNN) based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are rapidly gaining popularity, they are mainly designed for the widely-used bicubic degradation, and there still remains the fundamental challenge for them to super-resolve low-resolution (LR) image with arbitrary blur kernels. In the meanwhile, plug-and-play image restoration has been recognized with high flexibility due to its modular structure for easy plug-in of denoiser priors. In this paper, we propose a principled formulation and framework by extending bicubic degradation based deep SISR with the help of plug-and-play framework to handle LR images with arbitrary blur kernels. Specifically, we design a new SISR degradation model so as to take advantage of existing blind deblurring methods for blur kernel estimation. To optimize the new degradation induced energy function, we then derive a plug-and-play algorithm via variable splitting technique, which allows us to plug any super-resolver prior rather than the denoiser prior as a modular part. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real LR images demonstrate that the proposed deep plug-and-play super-resolution framework is flexible and effective to deal with blurry LR images."}
{"prompt": "TEXT: Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson celebrated the departure of national security adviser John Bolton last night, claiming the hardline defense hawk was 'a man of the left'. The outspoken TV host said Bolton, who supported regime change in the Middle East, believed that 'any human problem could be solved with the brute force of government'. Bolton's sacking was 'great news for America, especially for the large number of young people who would have been killed in pointless wars if Bolton had stayed on the job', Carlson said on his show last night. Bolton has long been seen as a villain on the left, but has now run afoul of Trump's supporters on the right after clashing with the President over foreign policy. He left the White House on Tuesday with a row over Trump's invitation to the Taliban apparently the final straw. 'If you're wondering why so many progressives are mourning Bolton's firing tonight, it's because Bolton himself fundamentally was a man of the left,' Carlson said. 'There was not a human problem John Bolton wasn't totally convinced could besolved with the brute force of government. 'That's an assumption of the left, not the right. Don't let the mustache fool you. John Bolton was one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration. 'The actual John Bolton is gone, likely forever, but the question tonight is will he be replaced by another John Bolton just like him?' Bolton was a vociferous advocate of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and has since called for regime change in Iran and pre-emptive strikes on North Korea. Far from being a 'man of the left', he was a favorite target of Democrats during the George W. Bush years and later wrote a book calledHow Barack Obama is Endangering our National Sovereignty. 'There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner,' he said during his term as ambassador to the United Nations under Bush. His experience in Washington dates back to the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s. Carlson quoted several Democrats and moderate Republicans who he said were 'mourning' Bolton's departure. Senator Chris Murphy said he was 'legitimately shaken by the grave instability of American foreign policy today'. However, he also added that he was 'no Bolton fan', a comment not cited by Carlson. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Bolton's dismissal was a sign of 'disarray' at the White House. QUERY: Which of the following headings matches the above text?

{"prompt": "TEXT: In condensed matter physics gauge symmetries other than the U(1) of electromagnetism are of an emergent nature. Two emergence mechanisms for gauge symmetry are well established: the way these arise in Kramers-Wannier type local-global dualities, and as a way to encode local constraints encountered in (doped) Mott insulators. We demonstrate that these gauge structures are closely related, and appear as counterparts in either the canonical or field-theoretical language. The restoration of symmetry in a disorder phase transition is due to having the original local variables subjected to a coherent superposition of all possible topological defect configurations, with the effect that correlation functions are no longer well-defined. This is completely equivalent to assigning gauge freedom to those variables. Two cases are considered explicitly: the well-known vortex duality in bosonic Mott insulators serves to illustrate the principle. The acquired wisdoms are then applied to the less familiar context of dualities in quantum elasticity, where we elucidate the relation between the quantum nematic and linearized gravity. We reflect on some deeper implications for the emergence of gauge symmetry in general. QUERY: What category best describes this paper?

{"prompt": "TEXT: The mother of a California college student who has been jailed in Japan for nearly nine months for breaking a lamp at a bar, is pleading for his release. Leah Smith said her son, Julian Adame, was traveling abroad when he was arrested and jailed in Toyko in May 2018. The University of Redlands student had been bar-hopping with two people he had met at his hostel. According to a GoFundMe account created by Smith, the college senior fell asleep at one of the bars. 'He woke to a policeman informing him he had broken a lamp and must pay 100,000 yen for it, roughly $900,' the account reads. Adame's mother said her son had been warned about Japanese gang members disguising themselves as officers to rob tourists. Fearing the officers were gang members, Adame refused to let them see his passport. He then 'called 911 thirteen times' as he was being transported to a community police box. 'Once at the hostel, an officer attempted to handcuff Julian. Startled, he resisted arrest. The police charged him with the Obstruction of the Performance of Official Duties, a minor, nonviolent, nondrug offense,' his mother said. Since Adame's arrest, his mother has hired a translator to help negotiate the cost of the lamp's replacement and figure out how much his fine will be. 'I'm losing it now at this point too,' Smith told Fox 40. 'I just want him home. This is ridiculous, he's not a criminal.' According to Smith, her son's lawyer said the lamp will cost around $850, but that price is being negotiated. The lawyer also told the worried mother that Adame's fine can reach $5,000 max for the offense. Adame's most recent hearing was scheduled for December 12, but the trial was postponed until mid-February. Smith told Fox 40 that the US embassy in Tokyo is forwarding her letters from her son. One letter says, 'I love you so much' while another reads: 'I'm scared and want to come home.' Smith said she is still fighting to bring her son home and started the GoFundMe to help raise funds to continue to pay for a translator and eventually her son's flight home.

{"prompt": "TEXT: We study the performance of voting mechanisms from a utilitarian standpoint, under the recently introduced framework of metric-distortion, offering new insights along three main lines. First, if $d$ represents the doubling dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is $O(d \\log \\log m)$, where $m$ represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the \"intrinsic dimensionality\" of the underlying metric space. We also establish a nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind. Moreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes. Specifically, we introduce simple, deterministic and decentralized exploration/exploitation dynamics, and we show that they converge to a candidate with $O(1)$ distortion. Finally, driven by applications in facility location games, we consider several refinements and extensions of the standard metric-setting. Namely, we prove that the deterministic mechanism recently introduced by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah (FOCS '20) attains the optimal distortion bound of $2$ under ultra-metrics, while it also comes close to our lower bound under distances satisfying approximate triangle inequalities.
